	abstract = {We describe a method based on a latent Dirichlet allocation model for predicting functional effects of noncoding genetic variants in a cell-type- and/or tissue-specific way (FUN-LDA). Using this unsupervised approach, we predict tissue-specific functional effects for every position in the human genome in 127 different tissues and cell types. We demonstrate the usefulness of our predictions by using several validation experiments. Using eQTL data from several sources, including the GTEx project, Geuvadis project, and TwinsUK cohort, we show that eQTLs in specific tissues tend to be most enriched among the predicted functional variants in relevant tissues in Roadmap. We further show how these integrated functional scores can be used for (1) deriving the most likely cell or tissue type causally implicated for a complex trait by using summary statistics from genome-wide association studies and (2) estimating a tissue-based correlation matrix of various complex traits. We found large enrichment of heritability in functional components of relevant tissues for various complex traits, and FUN-LDA yielded higher enrichment estimates than existing methods. Finally, using experimentally validated functional variants from the literature and variants possibly implicated in disease by previous studies, we rigorously compare FUN-LDA with state-of-the-art functional annotation methods and show that FUN-LDA has better prediction accuracy and higher resolution than these methods. In particular, our results suggest that tissue- and cell-type-specific functional prediction methods tend to have substantially better prediction accuracy than organism-level prediction methods. Scores for each position in the human genome and for each ENCODE and Roadmap tissue are available online (see Web Resources).},

	abstract = {Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCTS) is characterized by intervertebral fusions and fusion of the carpal and tarsal bones. Biallelic mutations in FLNB cause this condition in some families, whereas monoallelic variants in MYH3, encoding embryonic heavy chain myosin 3, have been implicated in dominantly inherited forms of the disorder. Here, five individuals without FLNB mutations from three families were hypothesized to be affected by recessive SCTS on account of sibling recurrence of the phenotype. Initial whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed that all five were heterozygous for one of two independent splice-site variants in MYH3. Despite evidence indicating that three of the five individuals shared two allelic haplotypes encompassing MYH3, no second variant could be located in the WES datasets. Subsequent genome sequencing of these three individuals demonstrated a variant altering a 5′ UTR splice donor site (rs557849165 in MYH3) not represented by exome-capture platforms. When the cohort was expanded to 16 SCTS-affected individuals without FLNB mutations, nine had truncating mutations transmitted by unaffected parents, and six inherited the rs557849165 variant in trans, an observation at odds with the population allele frequency for this variant. The rs557849165 variant disrupts splicing in the 5′ UTR but is still permissive of MYH3 translational initiation, albeit with reduced efficiency. Although some MYH3 variants cause dominant SCTS, these data indicate that others (notably truncating variants) do not, except in the context of compound heterozygosity for a second hypomorphic allele. These observations make genetic diagnosis challenging in the context of simplex presentations of the disorder.},

Phasing is generally performed via statistical phasing in a genotyped cohort, an approach that can yield high accuracy in very large cohorts but attains lower accuracy in smaller cohorts. Here we instead explore the paradigm of reference-based phasing. We introduce a new phasing algorithm, Eagle2, that attains high accuracy across a broad range of cohort sizes by efficiently leveraging information from large external reference panels (such as the Haplotype Reference Consortium; HRC) using a new data structure based on the positional Burrows-Wheeler transform. We demonstrate that Eagle2 attains a ∼20× speedup and ∼10\% increase in accuracy compared to reference-based phasing using SHAPEIT2. On European-ancestry samples, Eagle2 with the HRC panel achieves {\textgreater}2× the accuracy of 1000 Genomes–based phasing. Eagle2 is open source and freely available for HRC-based phasing via the Sanger Imputation Service and the Michigan Imputation Server.},

	abstract = {Deposition of crystallized monosodium urate (MSU) in joints as a result of hyperuricemia is a central risk factor for gout. However other factors must exist that control the progression from hyperuricaemia to gout. A previous genetic association study has implicated the toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) which activates the NLRP3 inflammasome via the nuclear factor-κB signaling pathway upon stimulation by MSU crystals. The T-allele of single nucleotide polymorphism rs2149356 in TLR4 is a risk factor associated with gout in a Chinese study. Our aim was to replicate this observation in participants of European and New Zealand Polynesian (Māori and Pacific) ancestry. A total of 2250 clinically-ascertained prevalent gout cases and 13925 controls were used. Non-clinically-ascertained incident gout cases and controls from the Health Professional Follow-up (HPFS) and Nurses Health Studies (NHS) were also used. Genotypes were derived from genome-wide genotype data or directly obtained using Taqman. Logistic regression analysis was done including age, sex, diuretic exposure and ancestry as covariates as appropriate. The T-allele increased the risk of gout in the clinically-ascertained European samples (OR = 1.12, P = 0.012) and decreased the risk of gout in Polynesians (OR = 0.80, P = 0.011). There was no evidence for association in the HPFS or NHS sample sets. In conclusion TLR4 SNP rs2143956 associates with gout risk in prevalent clinically-ascertained gout in Europeans, in a direction consistent with previously published results in Han Chinese. However, with an opposite direction of association in Polynesians and no evidence for association in a non-clinically-ascertained incident gout cohort this variant should be analysed in other international gout genetic data sets to determine if there is genuine evidence for association.},

	abstract = {Spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome (SCTS) is characterized by intervertebral fusions and fusion of the carpal and tarsal bones. Biallelic mutations in FLNB cause this condition in some families, whereas monoallelic variants in MYH3, encoding embryonic heavy chain myosin 3, have been implicated in dominantly inherited forms of the disorder. Here, five individuals without FLNB mutations from three families were hypothesized to be affected by recessive SCTS on account of sibling recurrence of the phenotype. Initial whole-exome sequencing (WES) showed that all five were heterozygous for one of two independent splice-site variants in MYH3. Despite evidence indicating that three of the five individuals shared two allelic haplotypes encompassing MYH3, no second variant could be located in the WES datasets. Subsequent genome sequencing of these three individuals demonstrated a variant altering a 5′ UTR splice donor site (rs557849165 in MYH3) not represented by exome-capture platforms. When the cohort was expanded to 16 SCTS-affected individuals without FLNB mutations, nine had truncating mutations transmitted by unaffected parents, and six inherited the rs557849165 variant in trans, an observation at odds with the population allele frequency for this variant. The rs557849165 variant disrupts splicing in the 5′ UTR but is still permissive of MYH3 translational initiation, albeit with reduced efficiency. Although some MYH3 variants cause dominant SCTS, these data indicate that others (notably truncating variants) do not, except in the context of compound heterozygosity for a second hypomorphic allele. These observations make genetic diagnosis challenging in the context of simplex presentations of the disorder.},

The last release of this project includes more than 2,500 sequenced individuals from 26 populations. Although relationships among individuals have been investigated in some of the populations, inbreeding has never been studied. In this article, we estimated the genomic inbreeding coefficient of each individual and found an unexpected high level of inbreeding in 1000 Genomes data: nearly a quarter of the individuals were inbred and around 4\% of them had inbreeding coefficients similar or greater than the ones expected for first-cousin offspring. Inbred individuals were found in each of the 26 populations, with some populations showing proportions of inbred individuals above 50\%. We also detected 227 previously unreported pairs of close relatives (up to and including first-cousins). Thus, we propose subsets of unrelated and outbred individuals, for use by the scientific community. In addition, because admixed populations are present in the 1000 Genomes Project, we performed simulations to study the robustness of inbreeding coefficient estimates in the presence of admixture. We found that our multi-point approach (FSuite) was quite robust to admixture, unlike single-point methods (PLINK).},

A Bayesian approach allows the calibration of p-values by transforming them to direct measures of the evidence against the null hypothesis, so-called Bayes factors. We review the available literature in this area and consider two-sided significance tests for a point null hypothesis in more detail. We distinguish simple from local alternative hypotheses and contrast traditional Bayes factors based on the data with Bayes factors based on p-values or test statistics. A well-known finding is that the minimum Bayes factor, the smallest possible Bayes factor within a certain class of alternative hypotheses, provides less evidence against the null hypothesis than the corresponding p-value might suggest. It is less known that the relationship between p-values and minimum Bayes factors also depends on the sample size and on the dimension of the parameter of interest. We illustrate the transformation of p-values to minimum Bayes factors with two examples from clinical research.},

Here we demonstrate the value of this resource for improving imputation accuracy at rare and low-frequency variants in both a UK and an Italian population. We show that large increases in imputation accuracy can be achieved by re-phasing WGS reference panels after initial genotype calling. We also present a method for combining WGS panels to improve variant coverage and downstream imputation accuracy, which we illustrate by integrating 7,562 WGS haplotypes from the UK10K project with 2,184 haplotypes from the 1000 Genomes Project.

We applied HLA imputation to genome-wide association study (GWAS) data for Graves' disease in Japanese (n = 9,003) and found that amino acid polymorphisms of multiple class I and class II HLA genes independently contribute to disease risk (HLA-DPB1, HLA-A, HLA-B and HLA-DRB1; P {\textless} 2.3 × 10−6), with the strongest impact at HLA-DPB1 (P = 1.6 × 10−42).

Here we analyzed summary statistics from 56 complex traits (average N = 101,401) by extending stratified LD score regression to continuous annotations. We determined that SNPs with low LLD have significantly larger per-SNP heritability and that roughly half of this effect can be explained by functional annotations negatively correlated with LLD, such as DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs). The remaining signal is largely driven by our finding that more recent common variants tend to have lower LLD and to explain more heritability (P = 2.38 × 10−104); the youngest 20\% of common SNPs explain 3.9 times more heritability than the oldest 20\%, consistent with the action of negative selection. We also inferred jointly significant effects of other LD-related annotations and confirmed via forward simulations that they jointly predict deleterious effects.},

Many relevant studies employ a case-control design, yet most methods are primarily geared toward analyzing quantitative traits. Here we investigate the validity of three common methods for estimating SNP-based heritability and genetic correlation between diseases. We find that the phenotype-correlation-genotype-correlation (PCGC) approach is the only method that can estimate both quantities accurately in the presence of important non-genetic risk factors, such as age and sex. We extend PCGC to work with arbitrary genetic architectures and with summary statistics that take the case-control sampling into account, and we demonstrate that our new method, PCGC-s, accurately estimates both SNP-based heritability and genetic correlations and can be applied to large datasets without requiring individual-level genotypic or phenotypic information. Finally, we use PCGC-s to estimate the genetic correlation between schizophrenia and bipolar disorder and demonstrate that previous estimates are biased, partially due to incorrect handling of sex as a strong risk factor.},

This new method is computationally tractable at very large sample sizes and leverages genome-wide information. Our findings include a large enrichment of heritability in conserved regions across many traits, a very large immunological disease–specific enrichment of heritability in FANTOM5 enhancers and many cell type–specific enrichments, including significant enrichment of central nervous system cell types in the heritability of body mass index, age at menarche, educational attainment and smoking behavior.},

We circumvent these difficulties by introducing a technique—cross-trait LD Score regression—for estimating genetic correlation that requires only GWAS summary statistics and is not biased by sample overlap. We use this method to estimate 276 genetic correlations among 24 traits. The results include genetic correlations between anorexia nervosa and schizophrenia, anorexia and obesity, and educational attainment and several diseases.

The first trend is towards “big” data: while automated analyses can exploit massive amounts of data, the interpretation—and possibly more importantly, the replication—of results are challenging without adequate statistical literacy. The second trend is that science and scientific publishing are struggling with insufficient/inappropriate statistical reasoning in writing, reviewing, and editing. This paper describes a model for statistical literacy (SL) and its development that can support modern scientific practice. An established curriculum development and evaluation tool—the Mastery Rubric—is integrated with a new, developmental, model of statistical literacy that reflects the complexity of reasoning and habits of mind that scientists need to cultivate in order to recognize, choose, and interpret statistical methods. This developmental model provides actionable evidence, and explicit opportunities for consequential assessment that serves students, instructors, developers/reviewers/accreditors of a curriculum, and institutions. By supporting the enrichment, rather than increasing the amount, of statistical training in the basic and life sciences, this approach supports curriculum development, evaluation, and delivery to promote statistical literacy for students and a collective quantitative proficiency more broadly.},

The MR for clinical research skills is built around a set of core research skills: critical review of literature; articulation of research objective; development of research design; development of analysis plan; implementation of the study; implementation of the analysis plan and presentation of results. Four distinct levels of performance are described for each skill: beginning, novice, competent and proficient. This rubric outlines and provides a path to mastery of the clinical research skills the certificate programme was designed and funded to target. Using the rubric to design the curriculum ensures that courses will provide instruction in key domains, promotes assessment that demonstrates development in the target skills and knowledge, and encourages reflection and cognitive self‐monitoring in the students. It is a flexible, criterion‐referenced definition of ‘success’ for students as well as the programme itself. The criteria are characterised in terms of the skills, habits of mind and organisational principles that can foster excellence in clinical research, but the approach can be generalised.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are the method most often used by geneticists to interrogate the human genome, and they provide a cost-effective way to identify the genetic variants underpinning complex traits and diseases. Most initial GWASs have focused on genetically homogeneous cohorts from European populations given the limited availability of ethnic minority samples and so as to limit population stratification effects. Transethnic studies have been invaluable in explaining the heritability of common quantitative traits, such as height, and in examining the genetic architecture of complex diseases, such as type 2 diabetes. They provide an opportunity for large-scale signal replication in independent populations and for cross-population meta-analyses to boost statistical power. In addition, transethnic GWASs enable prioritization of candidate genes, fine-mapping of functional variants, and potentially identification of SNPs associated with disease risk in admixed populations, by taking advantage of natural differences in genomic linkage disequilibrium across ethnically diverse populations. Recent efforts to assess the biological function of variants identified by GWAS have highlighted the need for large-scale replication, meta-analyses and fine-mapping across worldwide populations of ethnically diverse genetic ancestries. Here, we review recent advances and new approaches that are important to consider when performing, designing or interpreting transethnic GWASs, and we highlight existing challenges, such as the limited ability to handle heterogeneity in linkage disequilibrium across populations and limitations in dissecting complex architectures, such as those found in recently admixed populations.},

Here we present the structure of human ABCG2 determined by cryo-electron microscopy, providing the first high-resolution insight into a human multidrug transporter. We visualize ABCG2 in complex with two antigen-binding fragments of the human-specific, inhibitory antibody 5D3 that recognizes extracellular loops of the transporter. We observe two cholesterol molecules bound in the multidrug-binding pocket that is located in a central, hydrophobic, inward-facing translocation pathway between the transmembrane domains. Combined with functional in vitro analyses, our results suggest a multidrug recognition and transport mechanism of ABCG2, rationalize disease-causing single nucleotide polymorphisms and the allosteric inhibition by the 5D3 antibody, and provide the structural basis of cholesterol recognition by other G-subfamily ABC transporters.},

This review discusses the relevance of ABCG2 polymorphisms in gout, possible etiological mechanisms, and treatment approaches. The 141K ABCG2 urate-increasing variant causes instability in the nucleotide-binding domain, leading to decreased surface expression and function. Trafficking of the protein to the cell membrane is altered, and instead, there is an increased ubiquitin-mediated proteasomal degradation of the variant protein as well as sequestration into aggresomes. In humans, this leads to decreased uric acid excretion through both the kidney and the gut with the potential for a subsequent compensatory increase in renal urinary excretion. Not only does the 141K polymorphism in ABCG2 lead to hyperuricemia through renal overload and renal underexcretion, but emerging evidence indicates that it also increases the risk of acute gout in the presence of hyperuricemia, early onset of gout, tophi formation, and a poor response to allopurinol. In addition, there is some evidence that ABCG2 dysfunction may promote renal dysfunction in chronic kidney disease patients, increase systemic inflammatory responses, and decrease cellular autophagic responses to stress. These results suggest multiple benefits in restoring ABCG2 function. It has been shown that decreased ABCG2 141K surface expression and function can be restored with colchicine and other small molecule correctors. However, caution should be exercised in any application of these approaches given the role of surface ABCG2 in drug resistance.

We defined, using Bayes theorem, credible sets of SNPs that were 95\% likely, based on posterior probability, to contain the causal disease-associated SNPs. In 3 of the 14 regions, TCF7L2 (T2D), CTLA4 (Graves' disease) and CDKN2A-CDKN2B (T2D), much of the posterior probability rested on a single SNP, and, in 4 other regions (CDKN2A-CDKN2B (CAD) and CDKAL1, FTO and HHEX (T2D)), the 95\% sets were small, thereby excluding most SNPs as potentially causal. Very few SNPs in our credible sets had annotated functions, illustrating the limitations in understanding the mechanisms underlying susceptibility to common diseases.

	abstract = {We analyzed genome-wide association studies (GWASs), including data from 71,638 individuals from four ancestries, for estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to define chronic kidney disease (CKD). We identified 20 loci attaining genome-wide-significant evidence of association (p {\textless} 5 × 10−8) with kidney function and highlighted that allelic effects on eGFR at lead SNPs are homogeneous across ancestries. We leveraged differences in the pattern of linkage disequilibrium between diverse populations to fine-map the 20 loci through construction of “credible sets” of variants driving eGFR association signals. Credible variants at the 20 eGFR loci were enriched for DNase I hypersensitivity sites (DHSs) in human kidney cells. DHS credible variants were expression quantitative trait loci for NFATC1 and RGS14 (at the SLC34A1 locus) in multiple tissues. Loss-of-function mutations in ancestral orthologs of both genes in Drosophila melanogaster were associated with altered sensitivity to salt stress. Renal mRNA expression of Nfatc1 and Rgs14 in a salt-sensitive mouse model was also reduced after exposure to a high-salt diet or induced CKD. Our study (1) demonstrates the utility of trans-ethnic fine mapping through integration of GWASs involving diverse populations with genomic annotation from relevant tissues to define molecular mechanisms by which association signals exert their effect and (2) suggests that salt sensitivity might be an important marker for biological processes that affect kidney function and CKD in humans.},

We fit binomial regression models of gout incidence as a function of the covariates, age, type 2 diabetes, sex, and all main and interaction effects of the eight serum urate SNPs with BMI and renal disease. Models were also fit with a genetic risk score for serum urate levels which corresponds to the sum of risk alleles at the eight SNPs. Model covariates, age (P = 5.95E−06), sex (P = 2.46E−39), diabetes (P = 2.34E−07), BMI (P = 1.14E−11) and the SNPs, rs1967017 (P = 9.54E−03), rs13129697 (P = 4.34E−07), rs2199936 (P = 7.28E−03) and rs675209 (P = 4.84E−02) were all associated with incident gout. No BMI by SNP or BMI by serum urate genetic risk score interactions were statistically significant, but renal disease by rs1106766 was statistically significant (P = 6.12E−03). We demonstrated that minor alleles of rs1106766 (intergenic, INHBC) were negatively associated with the risk of incident gout in subjects without renal disease, but not for individuals with renal disease. These analyses demonstrate that a significant component of the risk of gout may involve complex interplay between genes and environment.},

	abstract = {Elevated serum uric acid levels cause gout and are a risk factor for cardiovascular disease and diabetes. To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2×10−201), ABCG2 (p = 3.1×10−26), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0×10−14), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7×10−14), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0×10−9), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1×10−8), GCKR (p = 1.4×10−9), LRRC16A (p = 8.5×10−9), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7×10−9). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women. To further characterize the identified variants, we analyzed their association with a panel of metabolites. rs12356193 within SLC16A9 was associated with DL-carnitine (p = 4.0×10−26) and propionyl-L-carnitine (p = 5.0×10−8) concentrations, which in turn were associated with serum UA levels (p = 1.4×10−57 and p = 8.1×10−54, respectively), forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites, and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight additional pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia. In addition, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport proteins are key in regulating serum uric acid levels.},

	abstract = {Objective A genome-wide association study (GWAS) of gout and its subtypes was performed to identify novel gout loci, including those that are subtype-specific.
Methods Putative causal association signals from a GWAS of 945 clinically defined gout cases and 1213 controls from Japanese males were replicated with 1396 cases and 1268 controls using a custom chip of 1961 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We also first conducted GWASs of gout subtypes. Replication with Caucasian and New Zealand Polynesian samples was done to further validate the loci identified in this study.
Results In addition to the five loci we reported previously, further susceptibility loci were identified at a genome-wide significance level (p{\textless}5.0×10−8): urate transporter genes (SLC22A12 and SLC17A1) and HIST1H2BF-HIST1H4E for all gout cases, and NIPAL1 and FAM35A for the renal underexcretion gout subtype. While NIPAL1 encodes a magnesium transporter, functional analysis did not detect urate transport via NIPAL1, suggesting an indirect association with urate handling. Localisation analysis in the human kidney revealed expression of NIPAL1 and FAM35A mainly in the distal tubules, which suggests the involvement of the distal nephron in urate handling in humans. Clinically ascertained male patients with gout and controls of Caucasian and Polynesian ancestries were also genotyped, and FAM35A was associated with gout in all cases. A meta-analysis of the three populations revealed FAM35A to be associated with gout at a genome-wide level of significance (pmeta=3.58×10−8).
Conclusions Our findings including novel gout risk loci provide further understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of gout and lead to a novel concept for the therapeutic target of gout/hyperuricaemia.},

Our aim was to test the loci for association with gout meeting the American College of Rheumatology gout classification criteria in New Zealand European and Polynesian case-control sample sets.
Methods 648 European cases and 1550 controls, and 888 Polynesian (Ma¯ori and Pacific) cases and 1095 controls were genotyped. Association with gout was tested by logistic regression adjusting for age and sex. Power was adequate ({\textgreater}0.7) to detect effects of OR{\textgreater}1.3.
Results We focused on 24 loci without previous consistent evidence for association with gout. In Europeans, we detected association at seven loci, one of which was the first report of association with gout (IGF1R). In Polynesian, association was detected at three loci. Meta-analysis revealed association at eight loci—two had not previously been associated with gout (PDZK1 and MAF). In participants with higher Polynesian ancestry, there was association in an opposing direction to Europeans at PRKAG2 and HLF (HLF is the first report of association with gout). There was obvious inconsistency of gout association at four loci (GCKR, INHBC, SLC22A11, SLC16A9) that display very similar effects on urate levels.
Conclusions We provide the first evidence for association with gout at four loci (IGF1R, PDZK1, MAF, HLF). Understanding why there is lack of correlation between urate and gout effect sizes will be important in understanding the aetiology of gout.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Hyperuricaemia, a highly heritable trait, is a key risk factor for gout. We aimed to identify novel genes associated with serum uric acid concentration and gout.
Methods
Genome-wide association studies were done for serum uric acid in 7699 participants in the Framingham cohort and in 4148 participants in the Rotterdam cohort. Genome-wide significant single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were replicated in white (n=11 024) and black (n=3843) individuals who took part in the study of Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC). The SNPs that reached genome-wide significant association with uric acid in either the Framingham cohort (p{\textless}5·0×10−8) or the Rotterdam cohort (p{\textless}1·0×10−7) were evaluated with gout. The results obtained in white participants were combined using meta-analysis.
Findings
Three loci in the Framingham cohort and two in the Rotterdam cohort showed genome-wide association with uric acid. Top SNPs in each locus were: missense rs16890979 in SLC2A9 (p=7·0×10−168 and 2·9×10−18 for white and black participants, respectively); missense rs2231142 in ABCG2 (p=2·5×10−60 and 9·8×10−4), and rs1165205 in SLC17A3 (p=3·3×10−26 and 0·33). All SNPs were direction-consistent with gout in white participants: rs16890979 (OR 0·59 per T allele, 95\% CI 0·52–0·68, p=7·0×10−14), rs2231142 (1·74, 1·51–1·99, p=3·3×10−15), and rs1165205 (0·85, 0·77–0·94, p=0·002). In black participants of the ARIC study, rs2231142 was direction-consistent with gout (1·71, 1·06–2·77, p=0·028). An additive genetic risk score of high-risk alleles at the three loci showed graded associations with uric acid (272–351 μmol/L in the Framingham cohort, 269–386 μmol/L in the Rotterdam cohort, and 303–426 μmol/L in white participants of the ARIC study) and gout (frequency 2–13\% in the Framingham cohort, 2–8\% in the Rotterdam cohort, and 1–18\% in white participants in the ARIC study).
Interpretation
We identified three genetic loci associated with uric acid concentration and gout. A score based on genes with a putative role in renal urate handling showed a substantial risk for gout.

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully identified common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with a wide variety of complex diseases, but do not address gene function or establish causality of disease-associated SNPs. We recently used GWAS to identify SNPs in a genomic region on chromosome 4 that associate with serum urate levels and gout, a consequence of elevated urate levels. Here we show using functional assays that human ATP-binding cassette, subfamily G, 2 (ABCG2), encoded by the ABCG2 gene contained in this region, is a hitherto unknown urate efflux transporter. We further show that native ABCG2 is located in the brush border membrane of kidney proximal tubule cells, where it mediates renal urate secretion. Introduction of the mutation Q141K encoded by the common SNP rs2231142 by site-directed mutagenesis resulted in 53\% reduced urate transport rates compared to wild-type ABCG2 (P {\textless} 0.001). Data from a population-based study of 14,783 individuals support rs2231142 as the causal variant in the region and show highly significant associations with urate levels [whites: P = 10−30, minor allele frequency (MAF) 0.11; blacks P = 10−4, MAF 0.03] and gout (adjusted odds ratio 1.68 per risk allele, both races). Our data indicate that at least 10\% of all gout cases in whites are attributable to this causal variant. With approximately 3 million US individuals suffering from often insufficiently treated gout, ABCG2 represents an attractive drug target. Our study completes the chain of evidence from association to causation and supports the common disease-common variant hypothesis in the etiology of gout.},

	abstract = {Gout based on hyperuricemia is a common disease with a genetic predisposition, which causes acute arthritis. The ABCG2/BCRP gene, located in a gout-susceptibility locus on chromosome 4q, has been identified by recent genome-wide association studies of serum uric acid concentrations and gout. Urate transport assays demonstrated that ABCG2 is a high-capacity urate secretion transporter. Sequencing of the ABCG2 gene in 90 hyperuricemia patients revealed several nonfunctional ABCG2 mutations, including Q126X. Quantitative trait locus analysis of 739 individuals showed that a common dysfunctional variant of ABCG2, Q141K, increases serum uric acid. Q126X is assigned to the different disease haplotype from Q141K and increases gout risk, conferring an odds ratio of 5.97. Furthermore, 10\% of gout patients (16 out of 159 cases) had genotype combinations resulting in more than 75\% reduction of ABCG2 function (odds ratio, 25.8). Our findings indicate that nonfunctional variants of ABCG2 essentially block gut and renal urate excretion and cause gout.
Dysfunctional genotype combinations of polymorphic adenosine 5′-triphosphate–binding cassette transporter gene ABCG2/BCRP, which encodes a high-capacity urate secretion transporter in human gut and kidney, are major causes of gout.

We prospectively evaluated the relationship between coffee intake and the risk of incident gout in a large cohort of men. Methods Over a 12-year period, we studied 45,869 men with no history of gout at baseline. Intake of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, tea, and total caffeine was assessed every 4 years through validated questionnaires. We used a supplementary questionnaire to ascertain whether participants met the American College of Rheumatology survey criteria for gout. Results We documented 757 confirmed incident cases of gout. Increasing coffee intake was inversely associated with the risk of gout. The multivariate relative risks (RRs) for incident gout according to coffee consumption categories (0, {\textless}1, 1–3, 4–5, and ≥6 cups per day) were 1.00, 0.97, 0.92, 0.60 (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.41–0.87), and 0.41 (95\% CI 0.19–0.88), respectively (P for trend = 0.009). For decaffeinated coffee, the multivariate RRs according to consumption categories (0, {\textless}1, 1–3, and ≥4 cups per day) were 1.00, 0.83, 0.67 (95\% CI 0.54–0.82), and 0.73 (95\% CI 0.46–1.17), respectively (P for trend = 0.002). Total caffeine from all sources and tea intake were not associated with the risk of gout. Conclusion These prospective data suggest that long-term coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of incident gout.},

A cohort of 2,046 initially healthy men in the Normative Aging Study was followed for 14.9 years with serial examinations and measurement of urate levels. With prior serum urate levels of 9 mg/dl or more, the annual incidence rate of gouty arthritis was 4.9 percent, compared with 0.5 percent for urate levels of 7.0 to 8.9 mg/dl and 0.1 percent for urate levels below 7.0 mg/dl. With urate levels of 9 mg/dl or higher, cumulative incidence of gouty arthritis reached 22 percent after five years. Incidence rates were three times higher for hypertensive patients than for normotensive patients (p {\textless}0.01). The strongest predictors of gout in a proportional hazards model were age, body mass index, hypertension, and cholesterol level, and alcohol intake. When the serum urate level became a factor in the model, none of these variables retained independent predictive power. At the final examination, only 0.7 percent of participants had a serum creatinine level of 2.0 mg/dl or more, with no evidence of renal deterioration attributable to hyperuricemia.

Associations for many of the loci were of similar magnitude in individuals of non-European ancestry. We further characterized these loci for associations with gout, transcript expression and the fractional excretion of urate. Network analyses implicate the inhibins-activins signaling pathways and glucose metabolism in systemic urate control. New candidate genes for serum urate concentration highlight the importance of metabolic control of urate production and excretion, which may have implications for the treatment and prevention of gout.},

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified many genetic loci associated with raised serum urate concentrations. However, hyperuricemia alone is not sufficient for the development of gout arthritis. Here we conduct a multistage GWAS in Han Chinese using 4,275 male gout patients and 6,272 normal male controls (1,255 cases and 1,848 controls were genome-wide genotyped), with an additional 1,644 hyperuricemic controls. We discover three new risk loci, 17q23.2 (rs11653176, P=1.36 × 10−13, BCAS3), 9p24.2 (rs12236871, P=1.48 × 10−10, RFX3) and 11p15.5 (rs179785, P=1.28 × 10−8, KCNQ1), which contain inflammatory candidate genes. Our results suggest that these loci are most likely related to the progression from hyperuricemia to inflammatory gout, which will provide new insights into the pathogenesis of gout arthritis.},

	abstract = {Objective Gout, caused by hyperuricaemia, is a multifactorial disease. Although genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of gout have been reported, they included self-reported gout cases in which clinical information was insufficient. Therefore, the relationship between genetic variation and clinical subtypes of gout remains unclear. Here, we first performed a GWAS of clinically defined gout cases only.
Methods A GWAS was conducted with 945 patients with clinically defined gout and 1213 controls in a Japanese male population, followed by replication study of 1048 clinically defined cases and 1334 controls.
Results Five gout susceptibility loci were identified at the genome-wide significance level (p{\textless}5.0×10−8), which contained well-known urate transporter genes (ABCG2 and SLC2A9) and additional genes: rs1260326 (p=1.9×10−12; OR=1.36) of GCKR (a gene for glucose and lipid metabolism), rs2188380 (p=1.6×10−23; OR=1.75) of MYL2-CUX2 (genes associated with cholesterol and diabetes mellitus) and rs4073582 (p=6.4×10−9; OR=1.66) of CNIH-2 (a gene for regulation of glutamate signalling). The latter two are identified as novel gout loci. Furthermore, among the identified single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we demonstrated that the SNPs of ABCG2 and SLC2A9 were differentially associated with types of gout and clinical parameters underlying specific subtypes (renal underexcretion type and renal overload type). The effect of the risk allele of each SNP on clinical parameters showed significant linear relationships with the ratio of the case–control ORs for two distinct types of gout (r=0.96 [p=4.8×10−4] for urate clearance and r=0.96 [p=5.0×10−4] for urinary urate excretion).
Conclusions Our findings provide clues to better understand the pathogenesis of gout and will be useful for development of companion diagnostics.},

Previous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified dozens of susceptibility loci for SU/gout, but few have been conducted for Chinese descent. Here, we try to extensively investigate whether these loci contribute to gout risk in Han Chinese. A total of 2255 variants in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with GWAS identified SU/gout associated variants were analyzed in a Han Chinese cohort of 1255 gout patients and 1848 controls. Cumulative genetic risk score analysis was performed to assess the cumulative effect of multiple “risk” variants on gout incidence. 23 variants (41\%) of LD pruned variants set (n = 56) showed nominal association with gout in our sample (p {\textless} 0.05). Some of the previously reported gout associated loci (except ALDH16A1), including ABCG2, SLC2A9, GCKR, ALDH2 and CNIH2, were replicated. Cumulative genetic risk score analyses showed that the risk of gout increased for individuals with the growing number (≥8) of the risk alleles on gout associated loci. Most of the gout associated loci identified in previous GWAS were confirmed in an independent Chinese cohort, and the SU associated loci also confer susceptibility to gout. These findings provide important information of the genetic association of gout.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies that scan the genome for common genetic variants associated with phenotype have greatly advanced medical knowledge. Hyperuricemia is no exception, with 28 loci identified. However, genetic control of pathways determining gout in the presence of hyperuricemia is still poorly understood. Two important pathways determining hyperuricemia have been confirmed (renal and gut excretion of uric acid with glycolysis now firmly implicated). Major urate loci are SLC2A9 and ABCG2. Recent studies show that SLC2A9 is involved in renal and gut excretion of uric acid and is implicated in antioxidant defense. Although etiological variants at SLC2A9 are yet to be identified, it is clear that considerable genetic complexity exists at the SLC2A9 locus, with multiple statistically independent genetic variants and local epistatic interactions. The positions of implicated genetic variants within or near chromatin regions involved in transcriptional control suggest that this mechanism (rather than structural changes in SLC2A9) is important in regulating the activity of SLC2A9. ABCG2 is involved primarily in extra-renal uric acid under-excretion with the etiological variant influencing expression. At the other 26 loci, probable causal genes can be identified at three (PDZK1, SLC22A11, and INHBB) with strong candidates at a further 10 loci. Confirmation of the causal gene will require a combination of re-sequencing, trans-ancestral mapping, and correlation of genetic association data with expression data. As expected, the urate loci associate with gout, although inconsistent effect sizes for gout require investigation. Finally, there has been no genome-wide association study using clinically ascertained cases to investigate the causes of gout in the presence of hyperuricemia. In such a study, use of asymptomatic hyperurcemic controls would be expected to increase the ability to detect genetic associations with gout.},

Although environmental factors contribute to hyperuricaemia, renal and gut excretion of urate is central to regulation of serum urate, and genetic factors are important. Activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome and release of interleukin 1β have key roles in initiation of acute gout flares. A "treat to target serum urate" approach is essential for effective gout management; long-term lowering of serum urate to less than 360 μmol/L leads to crystal dissolution and ultimately to suppression of flares. An allopurinol dose-escalation strategy is frequently effective for achieving treatment targets, and several new urate-lowering drugs are also available. Worldwide, rates of initiation and continuation of urate-lowering therapy are very low, and, consequently, achievement of serum urate targets is infrequent. Strategies to improve quality of gout care are needed.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

By following up the strongest signals of association from the trans-ethnic meta-analysis in an additional 21,491 cases and 55,647 controls of European ancestry, we identified seven new T2D susceptibility loci. Furthermore, we observed considerable improvements in the fine-mapping resolution of common variant association signals at several T2D susceptibility loci.

Using population genotype data from Finland and the UK Biobank, we show here that a reference panel of 1,000 individuals from the target population is adequate for a GWAS cohort of up to 10,000 individuals, whereas smaller panels, such as those from the 1000 Genomes Project, should be avoided. We also show, both theoretically and empirically, that the size of the reference panel needs to scale with the GWAS sample size; this has important consequences for the application of these methods in ongoing GWAS meta-analyses and large biobank studies. We conclude by providing software tools and by recommending practices for sharing LD information to more efficiently exploit summary statistics in genetics research.},

	abstract = {The detection of loci contributing effects to complex human traits, and their subsequent fine-mapping for the location of causal variants, remains a considerable challenge for the genetics research community. Meta-analyses of genomewide association studies, primarily ascertained from European-descent populations, have made considerable advances in our understanding of complex trait genetics, although much of their heritability is still unexplained. With the increasing availability of genomewide association data from diverse populations, transethnic meta-analysis may offer an exciting opportunity to increase the power to detect novel complex trait loci and to improve the resolution of fine-mapping of causal variants by leveraging differences in local linkage disequilibrium structure between ethnic groups. However, we might also expect there to be substantial genetic heterogeneity between diverse populations, both in terms of the spectrum of causal variants and their allelic effects, which cannot easily be accommodated through traditional approaches to meta-analysis. In order to address this challenge, I propose novel transethnic meta-analysis methodology that takes account of the expected similarity in allelic effects between the most closely related populations, while allowing for heterogeneity between more diverse ethnic groups. This approach yields substantial improvements in performance, compared to fixed-effects meta-analysis, both in terms of power to detect association, and localization of the causal variant, over a range of models of heterogeneity between ethnic groups. Furthermore, when the similarity in allelic effects between populations is well captured by their relatedness, this approach has increased power and mapping resolution over random-effects meta-analysis.

	abstract = {Genetic association studies, in particular the genome-wide association study (GWAS) design, have provided a wealth of novel insights into the aetiology of a wide range of human diseases and traits, in particular cardiovascular diseases and lipid biomarkers. The next challenge consists of understanding the molecular basis of these associations. The integration of multiple association datasets, including gene expression datasets, can contribute to this goal. We have developed a novel statistical methodology to assess whether two association signals are consistent with a shared causal variant. An application is the integration of disease scans with expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) studies, but any pair of GWAS datasets can be integrated in this framework. We demonstrate the value of the approach by re-analysing a gene expression dataset in 966 liver samples with a published meta-analysis of lipid traits including {\textgreater}100,000 individuals of European ancestry. Combining all lipid biomarkers, our re-analysis supported 26 out of 38 reported colocalisation results with eQTLs and identified 14 new colocalisation results, hence highlighting the value of a formal statistical test. In three cases of reported eQTL-lipid pairs (SYPL2, IFT172, TBKBP1) for which our analysis suggests that the eQTL pattern is not consistent with the lipid association, we identify alternative colocalisation results with SORT1, GCKR, and KPNB1, indicating that these genes are more likely to be causal in these genomic intervals. A key feature of the method is the ability to derive the output statistics from single SNP summary statistics, hence making it possible to perform systematic meta-analysis type comparisons across multiple GWAS datasets (implemented online at http://coloc.cs.ucl.ac.uk/coloc/). Our methodology provides information about candidate causal genes in associated intervals and has direct implications for the understanding of complex diseases as well as the design of drugs to target disease pathways.},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia based on the latest nationally representative sample of US men and women (National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES] 2007–2008). Methods Using data from 5,707 participants in NHANES 2007–2008, we estimated the prevalence of gout and hyperuricemia. During home interviews for NHANES 2007–2008, all participants were asked about a history of health professional– or physician-diagnosed gout. Our primary definition of hyperuricemia was a serum urate level of {\textgreater}7.0 mg/dl for men and {\textgreater}5.7 mg/dl for women. We explored potential secular trends in these estimates and their possible explanations by comparing them with estimates based on 18,825 participants in NHANES-III (1988–1994). Results The prevalence of gout among US adults in 2007–2008 was 3.9\% (8.3 million individuals). The prevalence among men was 5.9\% (6.1 million), and the prevalence among women was 2.0\% (2.2 million). The mean serum urate levels were 6.14 mg/dl among men and 4.87 mg/dl among women, corresponding to hyperuricemia prevalences of 21.2\% and 21.6\%, respectively. These estimates were higher than those in NHANES-III, with differences of 1.2\% in the prevalence of gout (95\% confidence interval [95\% CI] 0.6, 1.9), 0.15 mg/dl in the serum urate level (95\% CI 0.07, 0.24), and 3.2\% in the prevalence of hyperuricemia (95\% CI 1.2, 5.2). These differences were substantially attenuated after adjusting for body mass index and/or hypertension. Conclusion These findings from nationally representative samples of US adults suggest that the prevalence of both gout and hyperuricemia remains substantial and may have increased over the past 2 decades, which is likely related to increasing frequencies of adiposity and hypertension.},

The genetic contribution to the progression from hyperuricaemia to gout remains relatively poorly understood, although genes encoding proteins that are involved in the NLRP3 (NOD-, LRRand pyrin domain-containing 3) inflammasome pathway play a part. Genome-w ide and targeted sequencing is beginning to identify uncommon population-s pecific variants that are associated with urate levels and gout. Mendelian randomization studies using urate-a ssociated genetic variants as unconfounded surrogates for lifelong urate exposure have not supported claims that urate is causal for metabolic conditions that are comorbidities of hyperuricaemia and gout. Genetic studies have also identified genetic variants that predict responsiveness to therapies (for example, urate-lowering drugs) for treatment of hyperuricaemia. Future research should focus on large GWAS (that include asymptomatic hyperuricaemic individuals) and on increasing the use of whole-g enome sequencing data to identify uncommon genetic variants with increased penetrance that might provide opportunities for clinical translation.},

Motivated by the failure of LMMs to control type I errors in a GWAS of asthma, a binary trait, we show that LMMs are generally inappropriate for analyzing binary traits when population stratification leads to violation of the LMM’s constant-residual variance assumption. To overcome this problem, we develop a computationally efficient logistic mixed model approach for genome-wide analysis of binary traits, the generalized linear mixed model association test (GMMAT). This approach fits a logistic mixed model once per GWAS and performs score tests under the null hypothesis of no association between a binary trait and individual genetic variants. We show in simulation studies and real data analysis that GMMAT effectively controls for population structure and relatedness when analyzing binary traits in a wide variety of study designs.},

We identify a novel susceptibility signal in the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) locus centring on a haplotype of nonsynonymous variants in the IGHV4-61 gene segment corresponding to the IGHV4-61*02 allele. We show each copy of IGHV4-61*02 is associated with a 1.4-fold increase in the risk of RHD (odds ratio 1.43, 95\% confidence intervals 1.27–1.61, P=4.1 × 10−9).

We performed a trans-ancestry genome-wide association study of serum urate in 457,690 individuals, identifying 183 loci (147 previously unknown) that improve the prediction of gout in an independent cohort of 334,880 individuals. Serum urate showed significant genetic correlations with many cardiometabolic traits, with genetic causality analyses supporting a substantial role for pleiotropy. Enrichment analysis, fine-mapping of urate-associated loci and colocalization with gene expression in 47 tissues implicated the kidney and liver as the main target organs and prioritized potentially causal genes and variants, including the transcriptional master regulators in the liver and kidney, HNF1A and HNF4A. Experimental validation showed that HNF4A transactivated the promoter of ABCG2, encoding a major urate transporter, in kidney cells, and that HNF4A p.Thr139Ile is a functional variant. Transcriptional coregulation within and across organs may be a general mechanism underlying the observed pleiotropy between urate and cardiometabolic traits.},

We then partitioned the common SNP heritability of 111 genome-wide association study summary statistics of European (average n ≈ 189,000) and East Asian (average n ≈ 157,000) origin. IMPACT annotations captured consistent SNP heritability between populations, suggesting prioritization of shared functional variants. Variant prioritization using IMPACT resulted in increased trans-ancestry portability of polygenic risk scores from Europeans to East Asians across all 21 phenotypes analyzed (49.9\% mean relative increase in R2).

Through trans-ancestry meta-analysis of genome-wide association studies of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and independent replication (n = 1,046,070), we identified 264 associated loci (166 new). Of these, 147 were likely to be relevant for kidney function on the basis of associations with the alternative kidney function marker blood urea nitrogen (n = 416,178). Pathway and enrichment analyses, including mouse models with renal phenotypes, support the kidney as the main target organ. A genetic risk score for lower eGFR was associated with clinically diagnosed CKD in 452,264 independent individuals. Colocalization analyses of associations with eGFR among 783,978 European-ancestry individuals and gene expression across 46 human tissues, including tubulo-interstitial and glomerular kidney compartments, identified 17 genes differentially expressed in kidney. Fine-mapping highlighted missense driver variants in 11 genes and kidney-specific regulatory variants.

We describe an approximate Bayes factor that is straightforward to use and is appropriate when sample sizes are large. We consider various choices of the prior on the effect size, including those that allow effect size to vary with the minor allele frequency (MAF) of the marker. An important contribution is the description of a specific prior that gives identical rankings between Bayes factors and P-values, providing a link between the two approaches, and allowing the implications of the use of P-values to be more easily understood. As a summary measure of noteworthiness P-values are difficult to calibrate since their interpretation depends on MAF and, crucially, on sample size. A consequence is that a consistent decision-making procedure using P-values requires a threshold for significance that reduces with sample size, contrary to common practice. Genet.

	abstract = {Objective The first ever genome-wide association study (GWAS) of clinically defined gout cases and asymptomatic hyperuricaemia (AHUA) controls was performed to identify novel gout loci that aggravate AHUA into gout.
Methods We carried out a GWAS of 945 clinically defined gout cases and 1003 AHUA controls followed by 2 replication studies. In total, 2860 gout cases and 3149 AHUA controls (all Japanese men) were analysed. We also compared the ORs for each locus in the present GWAS (gout vs AHUA) with those in the previous GWAS (gout vs normouricaemia).
Results This new approach enabled us to identify two novel gout loci (rs7927466 of CNTN5 and rs9952962 of MIR302F) and one suggestive locus (rs12980365 of ZNF724) at the genome-wide significance level (p{\textless}5.0×10– 8). The present study also identified the loci of ABCG2, ALDH2 and SLC2A9. One of them, rs671 of ALDH2, was identified as a gout locus by GWAS for the first time. Comparing ORs for each locus in the present versus the previous GWAS revealed three ‘gout vs AHUA GWAS’-specific loci (CNTN5, MIR302F and ZNF724) to be clearly associated with mechanisms of gout development which distinctly differ from the known gout risk loci that basically elevate serum uric acid level.
Conclusions This meta-analysis is the first to reveal the loci associated with crystal-induced inflammation, the last step in gout development that aggravates AHUA into gout. Our findings should help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of gout development and assist the prevention of gout attacks in high-risk AHUA individuals.},

	abstract = {Objectives Genome-wide meta-analyses of clinically defined gout were performed to identify subtype-specific susceptibility loci. Evaluation using selection pressure analysis with these loci was also conducted to investigate genetic risks characteristic of the Japanese population over the last 2000–3000 years.
Methods Two genome-wide association studies (GWASs) of 3053 clinically defined gout cases and 4554 controls from Japanese males were performed using the Japonica Array and Illumina Array platforms. About 7.2 million single-nucleotide polymorphisms were meta-analysed after imputation. Patients were then divided into four clinical subtypes (the renal underexcretion type, renal overload type, combined type and normal type), and meta-analyses were conducted in the same manner. Selection pressure analyses using singleton density score were also performed on each subtype.
Results In addition to the eight loci we reported previously, two novel loci, PIBF1 and ACSM2B, were identified at a genome-wide significance level (p{\textless}5.0×10–8) from a GWAS meta-analysis of all gout patients, and other two novel intergenic loci, CD2-PTGFRN and SLC28A3-NTRK2, from normal type gout patients. Subtype-dependent patterns of Manhattan plots were observed with subtype GWASs of gout patients, indicating that these subtype-specific loci suggest differences in pathophysiology along patients’ gout subtypes. Selection pressure analysis revealed significant enrichment of selection pressure on ABCG2 in addition to ALDH2 loci for all subtypes except for normal type gout.
Conclusions Our findings on subtype GWAS meta-analyses and selection pressure analysis of gout will assist elucidation of the subtype-dependent molecular targets and evolutionary involvement among genotype, phenotype and subtype-specific tailor-made medicine/prevention of gout and hyperuricaemia.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) are valuable for understanding human biology, but associated loci typically contain multiple associated variants and genes. Thus, algorithms that prioritize likely causal genes and variants for a given phenotype can provide biological interpretations of association data. However, a critical, currently missing capability is to objectively compare performance of such algorithms. Typical comparisons rely on “gold standard” genes harboring causal coding variants, but such gold standards may be biased and incomplete. To address this issue, we developed Benchmarker, an unbiased, data-driven benchmarking method that compares performance of similarity-based prioritization strategies to each other (and to random chance) by leave-one-chromosome-out cross-validation with stratified linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression. We first applied Benchmarker to 20 well-powered GWASs and compared gene prioritization based on strategies employing three different data sources, including annotated gene sets and gene expression; genes prioritized based on gene sets had higher per-SNP heritability than those prioritized based on gene expression. Additionally, in a direct comparison of three methods, DEPICT and MAGMA outperformed NetWAS. We also evaluated combinations of methods; our results indicated that combining data sources and algorithms can help prioritize higher-quality genes for follow-up. Benchmarker provides an unbiased approach to evaluate any similarity-based method that provides genome-wide prioritization of genes, variants, or gene sets and can determine the best such method for any particular GWAS. Our method addresses an important unmet need for rigorous tool assessment and can assist in mapping genetic associations to causal function.},

The next challenge is to elucidate the causal genes and mechanisms involved. One approach is to use statistical colocalization to assess shared genetic aetiology across multiple related traits (e.g. molecular traits, metabolic pathways and complex diseases) to identify causal pathways, prioritize causal variants and evaluate pleiotropy. We propose HyPrColoc (Hypothesis Prioritisation for multi-trait Colocalization), an efficient deterministic Bayesian algorithm using GWAS summary statistics that can detect colocalization across vast numbers of traits simultaneously (e.g. 100 traits can be jointly analysed in around 1 s). We perform a genome-wide multi-trait colocalization analysis of coronary heart disease (CHD) and fourteen related traits, identifying 43 regions in which CHD colocalized with ≥1 trait, including 5 previously unknown CHD loci. Across the 43 loci, we further integrate gene and protein expression quantitative trait loci to identify candidate causal genes.},

We determine that squared trans-ethnic genetic correlation is 0.82× (s.e. 0.01) depleted in the top quintile of background selection statistic, implying more population-specific causal effect sizes. Accordingly, causal effect sizes are more population-specific in functionally important regions, including conserved and regulatory regions. In regions surrounding specifically expressed genes, causal effect sizes are most population-specific for skin and immune genes, and least population-specific for brain genes. Our results could potentially be explained by stronger gene-environment interaction at loci impacted by selection, particularly positive selection.},

	doi = {10.1093/hmg/ddaa013},
	abstract = {High serum urate is a prerequisite for gout and associated with metabolic disease. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have reported dozens of loci associated with serum urate control; however, there has been little progress in understanding the molecular basis of the associated loci. Here, we employed trans-ancestral meta-analysis using data from European and East Asian populations to identify 10 new loci for serum urate levels. Genome-wide colocalization with cis-expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) identified a further five new candidate loci. By cis- and trans-eQTL colocalization analysis, we identified 34 and 20 genes, respectively, where the causal eQTL variant has a high likelihood that it is shared with the serum urate-associated locus. One new locus identified was SLC22A9 that encodes organic anion transporter 7 (OAT7). We demonstrate that OAT7 is a very weak urate-butyrate exchanger. Newly implicated genes identified in the eQTL analysis include those encoding proteins that make up the dystrophin complex, a scaffold for signaling proteins and transporters at the cell membrane; MLXIP that, with the previously identified MLXIPL, is a transcription factor that may regulate serum urate via the pentose–phosphate pathway and MRPS7 and IDH2 that encode proteins necessary for mitochondrial function. Functional fine mapping identified six loci (RREB1, INHBC, HLF, UBE2Q2, SFMBT1 and HNF4G) with colocalized eQTL containing putative causal SNPs. This systematic analysis of serum urate GWAS loci identified candidate causal genes at 24 loci and a network of previously unidentified genes likely involved in control of serum urate levels, further illuminating the molecular mechanisms of urate control.},

	abstract = {In humans, most genome-wide association studies have been conducted using data from Caucasians and many of the reported findings have not replicated in other populations. This lack of replication may be due to statistical issues (small sample sizes or confounding) or perhaps more fundamentally to differences in the genetic architecture of traits between ethnically diverse subpopulations. What aspects of the genetic architecture of traits vary between subpopulations and how can this be quantified? We consider studying effect heterogeneity using Bayesian random effect interaction models. The proposed methodology can be applied using shrinkage and variable selection methods, and produces useful information about effect heterogeneity in the form of whole-genome summaries (e.g., the proportions of variance of a complex trait explained by a set of SNPs and the average correlation of effects) as well as SNP-specific attributes. Using simulations, we show that the proposed methodology yields (nearly) unbiased estimates when the sample size is not too small relative to the number of SNPs used. Subsequently, we used the methodology for the analyses of four complex human traits (standing height, high-density lipoprotein, low-density lipoprotein, and serum urate levels) in European-Americans (EAs) and African-Americans (AAs). The estimated correlations of effects between the two subpopulations were well below unity for all the traits, ranging from 0.73 to 0.50. The extent of effect heterogeneity varied between traits and SNP sets. Height showed less differences in SNP effects between AAs and EAs whereas HDL, a trait highly influenced by lifestyle, exhibited a greater extent of effect heterogeneity. For all the traits, we observed substantial variability in effect heterogeneity across SNPs, suggesting that effect heterogeneity varies between regions of the genome.},

We then conducted a trans-ancestry meta-analysis and discovered 35 additional new loci.

The PRS prioritized risk factors among various clinical parameters and segregated individuals with increased risk of long-term cardiovascular mortality.

	abstract = {White blood cell (WBC) count is a common clinical measure used as a predictor of certain aspects of human health, including immunity and infection status. WBC count is also a complex trait that varies among individuals and ancestry groups. Differences in linkage disequilibrium structure and heterogeneity in allelic effects are expected to play a role in the associations observed between populations. Prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses have identified genomic loci associated with WBC and its subtypes, but much of the heritability of these phenotypes remains unexplained. Using GWAS summary statistics for over 50 000 individuals from three diverse populations (Japanese, African-American and European ancestry), a Bayesian model methodology was employed to account for heterogeneity between ancestry groups. This approach was used to perform a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of total WBC, neutrophil and monocyte counts. Ten previously known associations were replicated and six new loci were identified, including several regions harboring genes related to inflammation and immune cell function. Ninety-five percent credible interval regions were calculated to narrow the association signals and fine-map the putatively causal variants within loci. Finally, a conditional analysis was performed on the most significant SNPs identified by the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (MA), and nine secondary signals within loci previously associated with WBC or its subtypes were identified. This work illustrates the potential of trans-ethnic analysis and ascribes a critical role to multi-ethnic cohorts and consortia in exploring complex phenotypes with respect to variants that lie outside the European-biased GWAS pool.},

We provide an in-depth discussion of FPRP, including a comparison with the q value, and examine the empirical behavior of these measures, along with BFDP, via simulation.

	abstract = {Bayes factor analysis has the attractive property of accommodating the risks of both false negatives and false positives when identifying susceptibility gene variants in genome-wide association studies (GWASs). For a particular SNP, the critical aspect of this analysis is that it incorporates the probability of obtaining the observed value of a statistic on disease association under the alternative hypotheses of non-null association. An approximate Bayes factor (ABF) was proposed by Wakefield (Genetic Epidemiology 2009;33:79–86) based on a normal prior for the underlying effect-size distribution. However, misspecification of the prior can lead to failure in incorporating the probability under the alternative hypothesis. In this paper, we propose a semi-parametric, empirical Bayes factor (SP-EBF) based on a nonparametric effect-size distribution estimated from the data. Analysis of several GWAS datasets revealed the presence of substantial numbers of SNPs with small effect sizes, and the SP-EBF attributed much greater significance to such SNPs than the ABF. Overall, the SP-EBF incorporates an effect-size distribution that is estimated from the data, and it has the potential to improve the accuracy of Bayes factor analysis in GWASs.},

Many of the underlying causal variants may affect enhancers2,3, but we lack accurate maps of enhancers and their target genes to interpret such variants. We recently developed the activity-by-contact (ABC) model to predict which enhancers regulate which genes and validated the model using CRISPR perturbations in several cell types4. Here we apply this ABC model to create enhancer–gene maps in 131 human cell types and tissues, and use these maps to interpret the functions of GWAS variants. Across 72 diseases and complex traits, ABC links 5,036 GWAS signals to 2,249 unique genes, including a class of 577 genes that appear to influence multiple phenotypes through variants in enhancers that act in different cell types. In inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), causal variants are enriched in predicted enhancers by more than 20-fold in particular cell types such as dendritic cells, and ABC achieves higher precision than other regulatory methods at connecting noncoding variants to target genes. These variant-to-function maps reveal an enhancer that contains an IBD risk variant and that regulates the expression of PPIF to alter the membrane potential of mitochondria in macrophages. Our study reveals principles of genome regulation, identifies genes that affect IBD and provides a resource and generalizable strategy to connect risk variants of common diseases to their molecular and cellular functions.},

In addition to 17 novel genome-wide significant cytokine QTLs (cQTLs), our study provides a comprehensive picture of the genetic variants that influence six different cytokines in whole blood, blood mononuclear cells, and macrophages. Important biological pathways that contain cytokine QTLs map to pattern recognition receptors (TLR1-6-10 cluster), cytokine and complement inhibitors, and the kallikrein system. The cytokine QTLs show enrichment for monocyte-specific enhancers, are more often located in regions under positive selection, and are significantly enriched among SNPs associated with infections and immune-mediated diseases.

	abstract = {Standard statistical approaches for prioritization of variants for functional testing in fine-mapping studies either use marginal association statistics or estimate posterior probabilities for variants to be causal under simplifying assumptions. Here, we present a probabilistic framework that integrates association strength with functional genomic annotation data to improve accuracy in selecting plausible causal variants for functional validation. A key feature of our approach is that it empirically estimates the contribution of each functional annotation to the trait of interest directly from summary association statistics while allowing for multiple causal variants at any risk locus. We devise efficient algorithms that estimate the parameters of our model across all risk loci to further increase performance. Using simulations starting from the 1000 Genomes data, we find that our framework consistently outperforms the current state-of-the-art fine-mapping methods, reducing the number of variants that need to be selected to capture 90\% of the causal variants from an average of 13.3 to 10.4 SNPs per locus (as compared to the next-best performing strategy). Furthermore, we introduce a cost-to-benefit optimization framework for determining the number of variants to be followed up in functional assays and assess its performance using real and simulation data. We validate our findings using a large scale meta-analysis of four blood lipids traits and find that the relative probability for causality is increased for variants in exons and transcription start sites and decreased in repressed genomic regions at the risk loci of these traits. Using these highly predictive, trait-specific functional annotations, we estimate causality probabilities across all traits and variants, reducing the size of the 90\% confidence set from an average of 17.5 to 13.5 variants per locus in this data.},

	abstract = {Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified thousands of regions in the genome that contain genetic variants that increase risk for complex traits and diseases. However, the variants uncovered in GWAS are typically not biologically causal, but rather, correlated to the true causal variant through linkage disequilibrium (LD). To discern the true causal variant(s), a variety of statistical fine-mapping methods have been proposed to prioritize variants for functional validation.In this work we introduce a new approach, fastPAINTOR, that leverages evidence across correlated traits, as well as functional annotation data, to improve fine-mapping accuracy at pleiotropic risk loci. To improve computational efficiency, we describe an new importance sampling scheme to perform model inference. First, we demonstrate in simulations that by leveraging functional annotation data, fastPAINTOR increases fine-mapping resolution relative to existing methods. Next, we show that jointly modeling pleiotropic risk regions improves fine-mapping resolution compared to standard single trait and pleiotropic fine mapping strategies. We report a reduction in the number of SNPs required for follow-up in order to capture 90\% of the causal variants from 23 SNPs per locus using a single trait to 12 SNPs when fine-mapping two traits simultaneously. Finally, we analyze summary association data from a large-scale GWAS of lipids and show that these improvements are largely sustained in real data.The fastPAINTOR framework is implemented in the PAINTOR v3.0 package which is publicly available to the research community http://bogdan.bioinformatics.ucla.edu/software/paintorSupplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Typically, however, variants are only analysed one-at-a-time. This complicates the ability of fine-mapping to identify a small set of SNPs for further functional follow-up. We describe a new and scalable algorithm, joint analysis of marginal summary statistics (JAM), for the re-analysis of published marginal summary stactistics under joint multi-SNP models. The correlation is accounted for according to estimates from a reference dataset, and models and SNPs that best explain the complete joint pattern of marginal effects are highlighted via an integrated Bayesian penalized regression framework. We provide both enumerated and Reversible Jump MCMC implementations of JAM and present some comparisons of performance. In a series of realistic simulation studies, JAM demonstrated identical performance to various alternatives designed for single region settings. In multi-region settings, where the only multivariate alternative involves stepwise selection, JAM offered greater power and specificity. We also present an application to real published results from MAGIC (meta-analysis of glucose and insulin related traits consortium) – a GWAS meta-analysis of more than 15,000 people. We re-analysed several genomic regions that produced multiple significant signals with glucose levels 2 hr after oral stimulation. Through joint multivariate modelling, JAM was able to formally rule out many SNPs, and for one gene, ADCY5, suggests that an additional SNP, which transpired to be more biologically plausible, should be followed up with equal priority to the reported index.},

	abstract = {We consider applying Bayesian Variable Selection Regression, or BVSR, to genome-wide association studies and similar large-scale regression problems. Currently, typical genome-wide association studies measure hundreds of thousands, or millions, of genetic variants (SNPs), in thousands or tens of thousands of individuals, and attempt to identify regions harboring SNPs that affect some phenotype or outcome of interest. This goal can naturally be cast as a variable selection regression problem, with the SNPs as the covariates in the regression. Characteristic features of genome-wide association studies include the following: (i) a focus primarily on identifying relevant variables, rather than on prediction; and (ii) many relevant covariates may have tiny effects, making it effectively impossible to confidently identify the complete “correct” subset of variables. Taken together, these factors put a premium on having interpretable measures of confidence for individual covariates being included in the model, which we argue is a strength of BVSR compared with alternatives such as penalized regression methods. Here we focus primarily on analysis of quantitative phenotypes, and on appropriate prior specification for BVSR in this setting, emphasizing the idea of considering what the priors imply about the total proportion of variance in outcome explained by relevant covariates. We also emphasize the potential for BVSR to estimate this proportion of variance explained, and hence shed light on the issue of “missing heritability” in genome-wide association studies. More generally, we demonstrate that, despite the apparent computational challenges, BVSR can provide useful inferences in these large-scale problems, and in our simulations produces better power and predictive performance compared with standard single-SNP analyses and the penalized regression method LASSO. Methods described here are implemented in a software package, pi-MASS, available from the Guan Lab website http://bcm.edu/cnrc/mcmcmc/pimass.},

Discordance between mitochondrial and nuclear genetic ancestry could contribute to phenotypic variation in admixed populations. Here, we explored potential mitonuclear incompatibility in six admixed human populations from the Americas: African Americans, African Caribbeans, Colombians, Mexicans, Peruvians and Puerto Ricans. By comparing nuclear versus mitochondrial ancestry in these populations, we first show that mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) copy number decreases with increasing discordance between nuclear and mtDNA ancestry. The direction of this effect is consistent across mtDNA haplogroups of different geographic origins. This observation indicates suboptimal regulation of mtDNA replication when its components are encoded by nuclear and mtDNA genes with different ancestry. Second, while most populations analysed exhibit no such trend, in African Americans and Puerto Ricans, we find a significant enrichment of ancestry at nuclear-encoded mitochondrial genes towards the source populations contributing the most prevalent mtDNA haplogroups (African and Native American, respectively). This possibly reflects compensatory effects of selection in recovering mitonuclear interactions optimized in the source populations. Our results provide evidence of mitonuclear interactions in human admixed populations and we discuss their implications for human health and disease.},

A comprehensive, genome-wide study of how selective constraints and adaptations have driven the evolution of innate immunity genes is missing. Using full-genome sequence variation from the 1000 Genomes Project, we first show that innate immunity genes have globally evolved under stronger purifying selection than the remainder of protein-coding genes. We identify a gene set under the strongest selective constraints, mutations in which are likely to predispose individuals to life-threatening disease, as illustrated by STAT1 and TRAF3. We then evaluate the occurrence of local adaptation and detect 57 high-scoring signals of positive selection at innate immunity genes, variation in which has been associated with susceptibility to common infectious or autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, we show that most adaptations targeting coding variation have occurred in the last 6,000–13,000 years, the period at which populations shifted from hunting and gathering to farming. Finally, we show that innate immunity genes present higher Neandertal introgression than the remainder of the coding genome. Notably, among the genes presenting the highest Neandertal ancestry, we find the TLR6-TLR1-TLR10 cluster, which also contains functional adaptive variation in Europeans. This study identifies highly constrained genes that fulfill essential, non-redundant functions in host survival and reveals others that are more permissive to change—containing variation acquired from archaic hominins or adaptive variants in specific populations—improving our understanding of the relative biological importance of innate immunity pathways in natural conditions.},

Efficient application of this method requires the use of a genomewide panel of ancestry-informative markers (AIMs) to infer the population of origin of chromosomal regions in admixed individuals. Genomewide AM panels with markers showing high frequency differences between West African and European populations are already available for disease-gene discovery in African Americans. However, no such a map is yet available for Hispanic/Latino populations, which are the result of two-way admixture between Native American and European populations or of three-way admixture of Native American, European, and West African populations. Here, we report a genomewide AM panel with 2,120 AIMs showing high frequency differences between Native American and European populations. The average intermarker genetic distance is ∼1.7 cM. The panel was identified by genotyping, with the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 500K array, a population sample with European ancestry, a Mesoamerican sample comprising Maya and Nahua from Mexico, and a South American sample comprising Aymara/Quechua from Bolivia and Quechua from Peru. The main criteria for marker selection were both high information content for Native American/European ancestry (measured as the standardized variance of the allele frequencies, also known as “f value”) and small frequency differences between the Mesoamerican and South American samples. This genomewide AM panel will make it possible to apply AM approaches in many admixed populations throughout the Americas.},

	abstract = {Objective Mitochondria have an important role in the induction of the NLRP3 inflammasome response central in gout. The objective was to test whether mitochondrial genetic variation and copy number in New Zealand Māori and Pacific (Polynesian) people in Aotearoa New Zealand associate with susceptibility to gout.
Methods 437 whole mitochondrial genomes from Māori and Pacific people (predominantly men) from Aotearoa New Zealand (327 people with gout, 110 without gout) were sequenced. Mitochondrial DNA copy number variation was determined by assessing relative read depth using data produced from whole genome sequencing (32 cases, 43 controls) and targeted resequencing of urate loci (151 cases, 222 controls). Quantitative PCR was undertaken for replication of copy number findings in an extended sample set of 1159 Māori and Pacific men and women (612 cases, 547 controls).
Results There was relatively little mitochondrial genetic diversity, with around 96\% of those sequenced in this study belonging to the B4a1a and derived sublineages. A B haplogroup heteroplasmy in hypervariable region I was found to associate with a higher risk of gout among the mitochondrial sequenced sample set (position 16181: OR=1.57, P=0.001). Increased copies of mitochondrial DNA were found to protect against gout risk with the effect being consistent when using hyperuricaemic controls across each of the three independent sample sets (OR=0.89, P=0.007; OR=0.90, P=0.002; OR=0.76, P=0.03). Paradoxically, an increase of mitochondrial DNA also associated with an increase in gout flare frequency in people with gout in the two larger sample sets used for the copy number analysis (β=0.003, P=7.1×10–7; β=0.08, P=1.2×10–4).
Conclusion Association of reduced copy number with gout in hyperuricaemia was replicated over three Polynesian sample sets. Our data are consistent with emerging research showing that mitochondria are important for the colocalisation of the NLRP3 and ASC inflammasome subunits, a process essential for the generation of interleukin-1β in gout.},

WBC count is also a complex trait that varies among individuals and ancestry groups. Differences in linkage disequilibrium structure and heterogeneity in allelic effects are expected to play a role in the associations observed between populations. Prior genome-wide association study (GWAS) meta-analyses have identified genomic loci associated with WBC and its subtypes, but much of the heritability of these phenotypes remains unexplained. Using GWAS summary statistics for over 50 000 individuals from three diverse populations (Japanese, African-American and European ancestry), a Bayesian model methodology was employed to account for heterogeneity between ancestry groups. This approach was used to perform a trans-ethnic meta-analysis of total WBC, neutrophil and monocyte counts. Ten previously known associations were replicated and six new loci were identified, including several regions harboring genes related to inflammation and immune cell function. Ninety-five percent credible interval regions were calculated to narrow the association signals and fine-map the putatively causal variants within loci. Finally, a conditional analysis was performed on the most significant SNPs identified by the trans-ethnic meta-analysis (MA), and nine secondary signals within loci previously associated with WBC or its subtypes were identified. This work illustrates the potential of trans-ethnic analysis and ascribes a critical role to multi-ethnic cohorts and consortia in exploring complex phenotypes with respect to variants that lie outside the European-biased GWAS pool.},

The approach is based on a new model—the ‘sum of single effects’ model, called ‘SuSiE’—which comes from writing the sparse vector of regression coefficients as a sum of ‘single-effect’ vectors, each with one non-zero element. We also introduce a corresponding new fitting procedure—iterative Bayesian stepwise selection (IBSS)—which is a Bayesian analogue of stepwise selection methods. IBSS shares the computational simplicity and speed of traditional stepwise methods but, instead of selecting a single variable at each step, IBSS computes a distribution on variables that captures uncertainty in which variable to select. We provide a formal justification of this intuitive algorithm by showing that it optimizes a variational approximation to the posterior distribution under SuSiE. Further, this approximate posterior distribution naturally yields convenient novel summaries of uncertainty in variable selection, providing a credible set of variables for each selection. Our methods are particularly well suited to settings where variables are highly correlated and detectable effects are sparse, both of which are characteristics of genetic fine mapping applications. We demonstrate through numerical experiments that our methods outperform existing methods for this task, and we illustrate their application to fine mapping genetic variants influencing alternative splicing in human cell lines. We also discuss the potential and challenges for applying these methods to generic variable-selection problems.},

	abstract = {Males and females present differences in complex traits and in the risk of a wide array of diseases. Genotype by sex (GxS) interactions are thought to account for some of these differences. However, the extent and basis of GxS are poorly understood. In the present study, we provide insights into both the scope and the mechanism of GxS across the genome of about 450,000 individuals of European ancestry and 530 complex traits in the UK Biobank. We found small yet widespread differences in genetic architecture across traits. We also found that, in some cases, sex-agnostic analyses may be missing trait-associated loci and looked into possible improvements in the prediction of high-level phenotypes. Finally, we studied the potential functional role of the differences observed through sex-biased gene expression and gene-level analyses. Our results suggest the need to consider sex-aware analyses for future studies to shed light onto possible sex-specific molecular mechanisms.},

Here, we review the possible scenarios by which DNA methylation and TF binding affect each other. Further in vivo experiments will be required to generalize these models.},

	abstract = {Mapping cis-acting expression quantitative trait loci (cis-eQTL) has become a popular approach for characterizing proximal genetic regulatory variants. In this paper, we describe and characterize log allelic fold change (aFC), the magnitude of expression change associated with a given genetic variant, as a biologically interpretable unit for quantifying the effect size of cis-eQTLs and a mathematically convenient approach for systematic modeling of cis-regulation. This measure is mathematically independent from expression level and allele frequency, additive, applicable to multiallelic variants, and generalizable to multiple independent variants. We provide efficient tools and guidelines for estimating aFC from both eQTL and allelic expression data sets and apply it to Genotype Tissue Expression (GTEx) data. We show that aFC estimates independently derived from eQTL and allelic expression data are highly consistent, and identify technical and biological correlates of eQTL effect size. We generalize aFC to analyze genes with two eQTLs in GTEx and show that in nearly all cases the two eQTLs act independently in regulating gene expression. In summary, aFC is a solid measure of cis-regulatory effect size that allows quantitative interpretation of cellular regulatory events from population data, and it is a valuable approach for investigating novel aspects of eQTL data sets.},

Here we present phASER, an accurate approach for phasing variants that are overlapped by sequencing reads, including those from RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), which often span multiple exons due to splicing. Using diverse RNA-seq data we demonstrate that this provides more accurate phasing of rare variants compared with population-based phasing and allows phasing of variants in the same gene up to hundreds of kilobases away that cannot be obtained from DNA sequencing (DNA-seq) reads. We show that in the context of medical genetic studies this improves the resolution of compound heterozygotes. Additionally, phASER provides measures of haplotypic expression that increase power and accuracy in studies of allelic expression. In summary, phasing using RNA-seq and phASER is accurate and improves studies where rare variant haplotypes or allelic expression is needed.},

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project aims to characterize variation in gene expression levels across individuals and diverse tissues of the human body, many of which are not easily accessible. Here we describe genetic effects on gene expression levels across 44 human tissues. We find that local genetic variation affects gene expression levels for the majority of genes, and we further identify inter-chromosomal genetic effects for 93 genes and 112 loci. On the basis of the identified genetic effects, we characterize patterns of tissue specificity, compare local and distal effects, and evaluate the functional properties of the genetic effects. We also demonstrate that multi-tissue, multi-individual data can be used to identify genes and pathways affected by human disease-associated variation, enabling a mechanistic interpretation of gene regulation and the genetic basis of disease.},

However, an underrepresentation of diverse populations has resulted in arrays that poorly capture global genetic variation, and a lack of reference panels. This has contributed to deepening global health disparities. Whole genome sequencing (WGS) better captures genetic variation but remains prohibitively expensive. Thus, we explored WGS at "mid-pass" 1-7x coverage.ResultsHere, we developed and benchmarked methods for mid-pass sequencing. When applied to a population without an existing genomic reference panel, 4x mid-pass performed consistently well across ethnicities, with high recall (98\%) and precision (97.5\%).ConclusionCompared to array data imputed into 1000 Genomes, mid-pass performed better across all metrics and identified novel population-specific variants with potential disease relevance.

	abstract = {ObjectiveThe Māori and Pacific (Polynesian) population of Aotearoa New Zealand has a high prevalence of gout. Our aim was to identify potentially functional missense genetic variants in candidate inflammatory genes amplified in frequency that may underlie the increased prevalence of gout in Polynesian populations.MethodsA list of 712 inflammatory disease-related genes was generated. An in silico targeted exome set was extracted from whole genome sequencing data in people with gout of various ancestral groups (Polynesian, European, East Asian; n = 55, 780, 135, respectively) to identify Polynesian-amplified common missense variants (minor allele frequency {\textgreater} 0.05). Candidate functional variants were tested for association with gout by multivariable-adjusted regression analysis in 2528 individuals of Polynesian ancestry.ResultsWe identified 26 variants common in the Polynesian population and uncommon in the European and East Asian populations. Three of the 26 population-amplified variants were nominally associated with the risk of gout (rs1635712 [KIAA0319], ORmeta = 1.28, P meta = 0.03; rs16869924 [CLNK], ORmeta = 1.37, P meta = 0.002; rs2070025 [fibrinogen A alpha chain (FGA)], ORmeta = 1.34, P meta = 0.02). The CLNK variant, within the established SLC2A9 gout locus, was genetically independent of the association signal at SLC2A9.ConclusionWe provide nominal evidence for the existence of population-amplified genetic variants conferring risk of gout in Polynesian populations. Polymorphisms in CLNK have previously been associated with gout in other populations, supporting our evidence for the association of this gene with gout.},

	abstract = {Gout is a complex inflammatory arthritis affecting {\textasciitilde}20\% of people with an elevated serum urate level (hyperuricemia). Gout and hyperuricemia are essentially specific to humans and other higher primates, with varied prevalence across ancestral groups. SLC2A9 and ABCG2 are major loci associated with both urate and gout in multiple ancestral groups. However, fine mapping has been challenging due to extensive linkage disequilibrium underlying the associated regions. We used trans-ancestral fine mapping integrated with primate-specific genomic information to address this challenge. Trans-ancestral meta-analyses of GWAS cohorts of either European (EUR) or East Asian (EAS) ancestry resulted in single-variant resolution mappings for SLC2A9 (rs3775948 for urate and rs4697701 for gout) and ABCG2 (rs2622621 for gout). Tests of colocalization of variants in both urate and gout suggested existence of a shared candidate causal variant for SLC2A9 only in EUR and for ABCG2 only in EAS. The fine-mapped gout variant rs4697701 was within an ancient enhancer, whereas rs2622621 was within a primate-specific transposable element, both supported by functional evidence from the Roadmap Epigenomics project in human primary tissues relevant to urate and gout. Additional primate-specific elements were found near both loci and those adjacent to SLC2A9 overlapped with known statistical epistatic interactions associated with urate as well as multiple super-enhancers identified in urate-relevant tissues. We conclude that by leveraging ancestral differences trans-ancestral fine mapping has identified ancestral and functional variants for SLC2A9 or ABCG2 with primate-specific regulatory effects on urate and gout.},

	abstract = {Explaining the genetics of many diseases is challenging because most associations localize to incompletely characterized regulatory regions. Using new computational methods, we show that transcription factors (TFs) occupy multiple loci associated with individual complex genetic disorders. Application to 213 phenotypes and 1,544 TF binding datasets identified 2,264 relationships between hundreds of TFs and 94 phenotypes, including androgen receptor in prostate cancer and GATA3 in breast cancer. Strikingly, nearly half of systemic lupus erythematosus risk loci are occupied by the Epstein–Barr virus EBNA2 protein and many coclustering human TFs, showing gene–environment interaction. Similar EBNA2-anchored associations exist in multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, inflammatory bowel disease, type 1 diabetes, juvenile idiopathic arthritis and celiac disease. Instances of allele-dependent DNA binding and downstream effects on gene expression at plausibly causal variants support genetic mechanisms dependent on EBNA2. Our results nominate mechanisms that operate across risk loci within disease phenotypes, suggesting new models for disease origins.},

We present a database of {\textgreater}270,000 independent mQTLs, of which 8.5\% comprise long-range (trans) associations. Identified mQTL associations explain 15–17\% of the additive genetic variance of DNAm. We show that the genetic architecture of DNAm levels is highly polygenic. Using shared genetic control between distal DNAm sites, we constructed networks, identifying 405 discrete genomic communities enriched for genomic annotations and complex traits. Shared genetic variants are associated with both DNAm levels and complex diseases, but only in a minority of cases do these associations reflect causal relationships from DNAm to trait or vice versa, indicating a more complex genotype–phenotype map than previously anticipated.},

	volume = {7},
	issn = {1664-8021},
	abstract = {Genome-wide Association Studies (GWAS) result in millions of summary statistics (“z-scores”) for single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) associations with phenotypes. These rich datasets afford deep insights into the nature and extent of genetic contributions to complex phenotypes such as psychiatric disorders, which are understood to have substantial genetic components that arise from very large numbers of SNPs. The complexity of the datasets, however, poses a significant challenge to maximizing their utility. This is reflected in a need for better understanding the landscape of z-scores, as such knowledge would enhance causal SNP and gene discovery, help elucidate mechanistic pathways, and inform future study design. Here we present a parsimonious methodology for modeling effect sizes and replication probabilities, relying only on summary statistics from GWAS substudies, and a scheme allowing for direct empirical validation. We show that modeling z-scores as a mixture of Gaussians is conceptually appropriate, in particular taking into account ubiquitous non-null effects that are likely in the datasets due to weak linkage disequilibrium with causal SNPs. The four-parameter model allows for estimating the degree of polygenicity of the phenotype and predicting the proportion of chip heritability explainable by genome-wide significant SNPs in future studies with larger sample sizes. We apply the model to recent GWAS of schizophrenia (N = 82,315) and putamen volume (N = 12,596), with approximately 9.3 million SNP z-scores in both cases. We show that, over a broad range of z-scores and sample sizes, the model accurately predicts expectation estimates of true effect sizes and replication probabilities in multistage GWAS designs. We assess the degree to which effect sizes are over-estimated when based on linear-regression association coefficients. We estimate the polygenicity of schizophrenia to be 0.037 and the putamen to be 0.001, while the respective sample sizes required to approach fully explaining the chip heritability are 106 and 105. The model can be extended to incorporate prior knowledge such as pleiotropy and SNP annotation. The current findings suggest that the model is applicable to a broad array of complex phenotypes and will enhance understanding of their genetic architectures.},

	doi = {10.1093/hmg/ddab130},
	abstract = {It is important to study the genetics of complex traits in diverse populations. Here, we introduce covariate-adjusted linkage disequilibrium (LD) score regression (cov-LDSC), a method to estimate SNP-heritability (\$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{2\}\})\$ and its enrichment in homogenous and admixed populations with summary statistics and in-sample LD estimates. In-sample LD can be estimated from a subset of the genome-wide association studies samples, allowing our method to be applied efficiently to very large cohorts. In simulations, we show that unadjusted LDSC underestimates \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{2\}\}\$ by 10–60\% in admixed populations; in contrast, cov-LDSC is robustly accurate. We apply cov-LDSC to genotyping data from 8124 individuals, mostly of admixed ancestry, from the Slim Initiative in Genomic Medicine for the Americas study, and to approximately 161 000 Latino-ancestry individuals, 47 000 African American-ancestry individuals and 135 000 European-ancestry individuals, as classified by 23andMe. We estimate \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{2\}\}\$ and detect heritability enrichment in three quantitative and five dichotomous phenotypes, making this, to our knowledge, the most comprehensive heritability-based analysis of admixed individuals to date. Most traits have high concordance of \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{2\}\}\$ and consistent tissue-specific heritability enrichment among different populations. However, for age at menarche, we observe population-specific heritability estimates of \$\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{h\}\}\_\{{\textbackslash}boldsymbol\{g\}\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mathbf\{2\}\}\$. We observe consistent patterns of tissue-specific heritability enrichment across populations; for example, in the limbic system for BMI, the per-standardized-annotation effect size \$ {\textbackslash}tau \$* is 0.16 ± 0.04, 0.28 ± 0.11 and 0.18 ± 0.03 in the Latino-, African American- and European-ancestry populations, respectively.

	abstract = {LD score regression is a reliable and efficient method of using genome-wide association study (GWAS) summary-level results data to estimate the SNP heritability of complex traits and diseases, partition this heritability into functional categories, and estimate the genetic correlation between different phenotypes. Because the method relies on summary level results data, LD score regression is computationally tractable even for very large sample sizes. However, publicly available GWAS summary-level data are typically stored in different databases and have different formats, making it difficult to apply LD score regression to estimate genetic correlations across many different traits simultaneously.In this manuscript, we describe LD Hub - a centralized database of summary-level GWAS results for 173 diseases/traits from different publicly available resources/consortia and a web interface that automates the LD score regression analysis pipeline. To demonstrate functionality and validate our software, we replicated previously reported LD score regression analyses of 49 traits/diseases using LD Hub; and estimated SNP heritability and the genetic correlation across the different phenotypes. We also present new results obtained by uploading a recent atopic dermatitis GWAS meta-analysis to examine the genetic correlation between the condition and other potentially related traits. In response to the growing availability of publicly accessible GWAS summary-level results data, our database and the accompanying web interface will ensure maximal uptake of the LD score regression methodology, provide a useful database for the public dissemination of GWAS results, and provide a method for easily screening hundreds of traits for overlapping genetic aetiologies.The web interface and instructions for using LD Hub are available at http://ldsc.broadinstitute.org/Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Here we describe the genomes of 1,092 individuals from 14 populations, constructed using a combination of low-coverage whole-genome and exome sequencing. By developing methods to integrate information across several algorithms and diverse data sources, we provide a validated haplotype map of 38 million single nucleotide polymorphisms, 1.4 million short insertions and deletions, and more than 14,000 larger deletions. We show that individuals from different populations carry different profiles of rare and common variants, and that low-frequency variants show substantial geographic differentiation, which is further increased by the action of purifying selection. We show that evolutionary conservation and coding consequence are key determinants of the strength of purifying selection, that rare-variant load varies substantially across biological pathways, and that each individual contains hundreds of rare non-coding variants at conserved sites, such as motif-disrupting changes in transcription-factor-binding sites. This resource, which captures up to 98\% of accessible single nucleotide polymorphisms at a frequency of 1\% in related populations, enables analysis of common and low-frequency variants in individuals from diverse, including admixed, populations.},

	abstract = {Next-generation sequencing studies are dependent on a high-quality reference genome for single nucleotide variant (SNV) calling. Although the two most recent builds of the human genome are widely used, position information is typically not directly comparable between them. Re-alignment gives the most accurate position information, but this procedure is often computationally expensive, and therefore, tools such as liftOver and CrossMap are used to convert data from one build to another. However, the positions of converted SNVs do not always match SNVs derived from aligned data, and in some instances, SNVs are known to change chromosome when converted. This is a significant problem when compiling sequencing resources or comparing results across studies. Here, we describe a novel algorithm to identify positions that are unstable when converting between human genome reference builds. These positions are detected independent of the conversion tools and are determined by the chain files, which provide a mapping of contiguous positions from one build to another. We also provide the list of unstable positions for converting between the two most commonly used builds GRCh37 and GRCh38. Pre-excluding SNVs at these positions, prior to conversion, results in SNVs that are stable to conversion. This simple procedure gives the same final list of stable SNVs as applying the algorithm and subsequently removing variants at unstable positions. This work highlights the care that must be taken when converting SNVs between genome builds and provides a simple method for ensuring higher confidence converted data.

	abstract = {The vast majority of coding variants are rare, and assessment of the contribution of rare variants to complex traits is hampered by low statistical power and limited functional data. Improved methods for predicting the pathogenicity of rare coding variants are needed to facilitate the discovery of disease variants from exome sequencing studies. We developed REVEL (rare exome variant ensemble learner), an ensemble method for predicting the pathogenicity of missense variants on the basis of individual tools: MutPred, FATHMM, VEST, PolyPhen, SIFT, PROVEAN, MutationAssessor, MutationTaster, LRT, GERP, SiPhy, phyloP, and phastCons. REVEL was trained with recently discovered pathogenic and rare neutral missense variants, excluding those previously used to train its constituent tools. When applied to two independent test sets, REVEL had the best overall performance (p {\textless} 10−12) as compared to any individual tool and seven ensemble methods: MetaSVM, MetaLR, KGGSeq, Condel, CADD, DANN, and Eigen. Importantly, REVEL also had the best performance for distinguishing pathogenic from rare neutral variants with allele frequencies {\textless}0.5\%. The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) for REVEL was 0.046–0.182 higher in an independent test set of 935 recent SwissVar disease variants and 123,935 putatively neutral exome sequencing variants and 0.027–0.143 higher in an independent test set of 1,953 pathogenic and 2,406 benign variants recently reported in ClinVar than the AUCs for other ensemble methods. We provide pre-computed REVEL scores for all possible human missense variants to facilitate the identification of pathogenic variants in the sea of rare variants discovered as sequencing studies expand in scale.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Technological advances have enabled the identification of an increasingly large spectrum of single nucleotide variants within the human genome, many of which may be associated with monogenic disease or complex traits. Here, we propose an integrative approach, named FATHMM-MKL, to predict the functional consequences of both coding and non-coding sequence variants. Our method utilizes various genomic annotations, which have recently become available, and learns to weight the significance of each component annotation source.Results: We show that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art algorithms, CADD and GWAVA, when predicting the functional consequences of non-coding variants. In addition, FATHMM-MKL is comparable to the best of these algorithms when predicting the impact of coding variants. The method includes a confidence measure to rank order predictions.Availability and implementation: The FATHMM-MKL webserver is available at: http://fathmm.biocompute.org.ukContact:H.Shihab@bristol.ac.uk or Mark.Rogers@bristol.ac.ukorC.Campbell@bristol.ac.ukSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

Genetic variants in functional regions of the genome are enriched for complex trait heritability. Here, we introduce a method for polygenic prediction, LDpred-funct, that leverages trait-specific functional priors to increase prediction accuracy. We fit priors using the recently developed baseline-LD model, including coding, conserved, regulatory, and LD-related annotations. We analytically estimate posterior mean causal effect sizes and then use cross-validation to regularize these estimates, improving prediction accuracy for sparse architectures. We applied LDpred-funct to predict 21 highly heritable traits in the UK Biobank (avg N = 373 K as training data). LDpred-funct attained a +4.6\% relative improvement in average prediction accuracy (avg prediction R2 = 0.144; highest R2 = 0.413 for height) compared to SBayesR (the best method that does not incorporate functional information). For height, meta-analyzing training data from UK Biobank and 23andMe cohorts (N = 1107 K) increased prediction R2 to 0.431. Our results show that incorporating functional priors improves polygenic prediction accuracy, consistent with the functional architecture of complex traits.},

	abstract = {Polygenic risk scores have shown great promise in predicting complex disease risk and will become more accurate as training sample sizes increase. The standard approach for calculating risk scores involves linkage disequilibrium (LD)-based marker pruning and applying a p value threshold to association statistics, but this discards information and can reduce predictive accuracy. We introduce LDpred, a method that infers the posterior mean effect size of each marker by using a prior on effect sizes and LD information from an external reference panel. Theory and simulations show that LDpred outperforms the approach of pruning followed by thresholding, particularly at large sample sizes. Accordingly, predicted R2 increased from 20.1\% to 25.3\% in a large schizophrenia dataset and from 9.8\% to 12.0\% in a large multiple sclerosis dataset. A similar relative improvement in accuracy was observed for three additional large disease datasets and for non-European schizophrenia samples. The advantage of LDpred over existing methods will grow as sample sizes increase.},

However, these patients were largely excluded from SARS-CoV-2 vaccine clinical trials, creating a large evidence gap.To identify the incidence rate and incidence rate ratio (IRR) for COVID-19 breakthrough infection after SARS-CoV-2 vaccination among persons with or without immune dysfunction.This retrospective cohort study analyzed data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), a partnership that developed a secure, centralized electronic medical record–based repository of COVID-19 clinical data from academic medical centers across the US. Persons who received at least 1 dose of a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine between December 10, 2020, and September 16, 2021, were included in the sample.Vaccination, COVID-19 diagnosis, immune dysfunction diagnoses (ie, HIV infection, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, solid organ transplant, and bone marrow transplantation), other comorbid conditions, and demographic data were accessed through the N3C Data Enclave. Breakthrough infection was defined as a COVID-19 infection that was contracted on or after the 14th day of vaccination, and the risk after full or partial vaccination was assessed for patients with or without immune dysfunction using Poisson regression with robust SEs. Poisson regression models were controlled for a study period (before or after [pre– or post–Delta variant] June 20, 2021), full vaccination status, COVID-19 infection before vaccination, demographic characteristics, geographic location, and comorbidity burden.A total of 664 722 patients in the N3C sample were included. These patients had a median (IQR) age of 51 (34-66) years and were predominantly women (n = 378 307 [56.9\%]). Overall, the incidence rate for COVID-19 breakthrough infection was 5.0 per 1000 person-months among fully vaccinated persons but was higher after the Delta variant became the dominant SARS-CoV-2 strain (incidence rate before vs after June 20, 2021, 2.2 [95\% CI, 2.2-2.2] vs 7.3 [95\% CI, 7.3-7.4] per 1000 person-months). Compared with partial vaccination, full vaccination was associated with a 28\% reduced risk for breakthrough infection (adjusted IRR [AIRR], 0.72; 95\% CI, 0.68-0.76). People with a breakthrough infection after full vaccination were more likely to be older and women. People with HIV infection (AIRR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.18-1.49), rheumatoid arthritis (AIRR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.09-1.32), and solid organ transplant (AIRR, 2.16; 95\% CI, 1.96-2.38) had a higher rate of breakthrough infection.This cohort study found that full vaccination was associated with reduced risk of COVID-19 breakthrough infection, regardless of the immune status of patients. Despite full vaccination, persons with immune dysfunction had substantially higher risk for COVID-19 breakthrough infection than those without such a condition. For persons with immune dysfunction, continued use of nonpharmaceutical interventions (eg, mask wearing) and alternative vaccine strategies (eg, additional doses or immunogenicity testing) are recommended even after full vaccination.},

	abstract = {Background
Many individuals take long-term immunosuppressive medications. We evaluated whether these individuals have worse outcomes when hospitalised with COVID-19 compared with non-immunosuppressed individuals.

Methods
We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the National COVID Cohort Collaborative (N3C), the largest longitudinal electronic health record repository of patients in hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 in the USA, between Jan 1, 2020, and June 11, 2021, within 42 health systems. We compared adults with immunosuppressive medications used before admission to adults without long-term immunosuppression. We considered immunosuppression overall, as well as by 15 classes of medication and three broad indications for immunosuppressive medicines. We used Fine and Gray's proportional subdistribution hazards models to estimate the hazard ratio (HR) for the risk of invasive mechanical ventilation, with the competing risk of death. We used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate HRs for in-hospital death. Models were adjusted using doubly robust propensity score methodology.

Findings
Among 231 830 potentially eligible adults in the N3C repository who were admitted to hospital with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 during the study period, 222 575 met the inclusion criteria (mean age 59 years [SD 19]; 111 269 [50\%] male). The most common comorbidities were diabetes (23\%), pulmonary disease (17\%), and renal disease (13\%). 16 494 (7\%) patients had long-term immunosuppression with medications for diverse conditions, including rheumatological disease (33\%), solid organ transplant (26\%), or cancer (22\%). In the propensity score matched cohort (including 12 841 immunosuppressed patients and 29 386 non-immunosuppressed patients), immunosuppression was associated with a reduced risk of invasive ventilation (HR 0·89, 95\% CI 0·83–0·96) and there was no overall association between long-term immunosuppression and the risk of in-hospital death. None of the 15 medication classes examined were associated with an increased risk of invasive mechanical ventilation. Although there was no statistically significant association between most drugs and in-hospital death, increases were found with rituximab for rheumatological disease (1·72, 1·10–2·69) and for cancer (2·57, 1·86–3·56). Results were generally consistent across subgroup analyses that considered race and ethnicity or sex, as well as across sensitivity analyses that varied exposure, covariate, and outcome definitions.

Interpretation
Among this cohort, with the exception of rituximab, there was no increased risk of mechanical ventilation or in-hospital death for the rheumatological, antineoplastic, or antimetabolite therapies examined.

        Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has resulted in significant morbidity and mortality in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients. The National COVID Cohort Collaborative was developed to facilitate analysis of patient-level data for those tested for COVID-19 across the United States.
        Methods. 
        In this study, we identified a cohort of SOT recipients testing positive or negative for COVID-19 (COVID+ and COVID−, respectively) between January 1, 2020, and November 20, 2020. Univariable and multivariable logistic regression were used to determine predictors of a positive result among those tested. Outcomes following COVID-19 diagnosis were also explored.
        Results. 
        Of 18 121 SOT patients tested, 1925 were positive (10.6\%). COVID+ SOT patients were more likely to have a kidney transplant and be non-White race. Comorbidities were common in all SOT patients but significantly more common in those who were COVID+. Of COVID+ SOT, 42.9\% required hospital admission. COVID+ status was the strongest predictor of acute kidney injury (AKI), rejection, and graft failure in the 90 d after testing. A total of 40.9\% of COVID+ SOT experienced a major adverse renal or cardiac event, 16.3\% experienced a major adverse cardiac event, 35.3\% experienced AKI, and 1.5\% experienced graft loss.
        Conclusions. 
        In the largest US cohort of COVID+ SOT recipients to date, we identified patient factors associated with the diagnosis of COVID-19 and outcomes following infection, including a high incidence of major adverse renal or cardiac event and AKI.},

Differences between groups over time were evaluated using multivariable logistic regression. Random forest and XGBoost models were used to predict severe clinical course (death, discharge to hospice, invasive ventilatory support, or extracorporeal membrane oxygenation).Patient demographic characteristics and COVID-19 severity using the World Health Organization COVID-19 severity scale and differences between groups over time using multivariable logistic regression.The cohort included 174 568 adults who tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 44.4 [18.6] years; 53.2\% female) and 1 133 848 adult controls who tested negative for SARS-CoV-2 (mean [SD] age, 49.5 [19.2] years; 57.1\% female). Of the 174 568 adults with SARS-CoV-2, 32 472 (18.6\%) were hospitalized, and 6565 (20.2\%) of those had a severe clinical course (invasive ventilatory support, extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, death, or discharge to hospice). Of the hospitalized patients, mortality was 11.6\% overall and decreased from 16.4\% in March to April 2020 to 8.6\% in September to October 2020 (P = .002 for monthly trend). Using 64 inputs available on the first hospital day, this study predicted a severe clinical course using random forest and XGBoost models (area under the receiver operating curve = 0.87 for both) that were stable over time. The factor most strongly associated with clinical severity was pH; this result was consistent across machine learning methods. In a separate multivariable logistic regression model built for inference, age (odds ratio [OR], 1.03 per year; 95\% CI, 1.03-1.04), male sex (OR, 1.60; 95\% CI, 1.51-1.69), liver disease (OR, 1.20; 95\% CI, 1.08-1.34), dementia (OR, 1.26; 95\% CI, 1.13-1.41), African American (OR, 1.12; 95\% CI, 1.05-1.20) and Asian (OR, 1.33; 95\% CI, 1.12-1.57) race, and obesity (OR, 1.36; 95\% CI, 1.27-1.46) were independently associated with higher clinical severity.This cohort study found that COVID-19 mortality decreased over time during 2020 and that patient demographic characteristics and comorbidities were associated with higher clinical severity. The machine learning models accurately predicted ultimate clinical severity using commonly collected clinical data from the first 24 hours of a hospital admission.},

Here we use exome sequence data on 628,388 individuals to identify 40,208 carriers of clonal haematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). Using genome-wide and exome-wide association analyses, we identify 24 loci (21 of which are novel) where germline genetic variation influences predisposition to CHIP, including missense variants in the lymphocytic antigen coding gene LY75, which are associated with reduced incidence of CHIP. We also identify novel rare variant associations with clonal haematopoiesis and telomere length. Analysis of 5,041 health traits from the UK Biobank (UKB) found relationships between CHIP and severe COVID-19 outcomes, cardiovascular disease, haematologic traits, malignancy, smoking, obesity, infection and all-cause mortality. Longitudinal and Mendelian randomization analyses revealed that CHIP is associated with solid cancers, including non-melanoma skin cancer and lung cancer, and that CHIP linked to DNMT3A is associated with the subsequent development of myeloid but not lymphoid leukaemias. Additionally, contrary to previous findings from the initial 50,000 UKB exomes6, our results in the full sample do not support a role for IL-6 inhibition in reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease among CHIP carriers. Our findings demonstrate that CHIP represents a complex set of heterogeneous phenotypes with shared and unique germline genetic causes and varied clinical implications.},

The measurements included not only the total uric acid-N15 enrichment but also the N15 abundance of each of the four uric acid nitrogens. Two noteworthy abnormalities were found in the patients with primary gout. One was in the initial intramolecular distribution of uric acid-N15, characterized by consistently disproportionate isotope enrichment of N-9 and N-3, both derived from the amide nitrogen of glutamine. The other was in the urinary total N16 partition, characterized by a deficiency in urinary ammonium-N15 excretion due to a defect in renal production of ammonia from glutamine. An abnormality of glutamine metabolism in primary gout is implied. It is suggested that the abnormality in glutamine metabolism described may have significance for the pathogenesis of primary gout. A defect in utilization of glutamine for renal production of ammonia (? glutaminase deficiency) might enhance uric acid production by recycling extra glutamine into the first and apparently rate-determining reaction of de novo purine biosynthesis, and moreover would predispose to uric acid stone formation.},

	abstract = {Gout is a chronic disease of monosodium urate crystal deposition in the setting of hyperuricemia that typically presents with recurrent flares of acute inflammatory arthritis that occur due to innate immune response to deposited crystals. The molecular mechanism of the progression from hyperuricemia to clinical gout is poorly understood. Here we provide insights into this progression from a genetic study of 2.6 million people, including 120,282 people with gout. We detected 376 loci and 410 genetically independent signals (148 new loci in urate and gout). We identified 1,768 candidate genes with subsequent pathway analysis revealing urate metabolism, type 2 diabetes, and chromatin modification and structure as top pathways in gout. Genes located within or statistically linked to significant GWAS loci were prioitized for their potential to control the progression from hyperuricemia to gout. This identified strong candidate immune genes involved in epigenetic remodelling, cell osmolarity, and regulation of NLRP3-inflammasome activity. The genetic association signal at XDH, encoding the urate-producing enzyme xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR), co-localizes with genetic control of XDH expression, but only in the prostate. We demonstrate XOR activity and urate production in the mouse prostate, and use single-cell RNA sequence data to propose a model of urate reuptake, synthesis, and secretion by the prostate. The gout-associated loci were over-represented for genes implicated in clonal hematopoeiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) and Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence for a causal role of CHIP in gout. In concert with implication of epigenomic regulators, this provides support for epigenomic remodelling as causal in gout. We provide new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of gout and identify an array of candidate genes for a role in the inflammatory process of gout.},

	abstract = {The diacylglycerol kinases (DGKs) are a family of enzymes responsible for the conversion of diacylglycerol (DAG) to phosphatidic acid (PA). In addition to their primary function in lipid metabolism, DGKs have recently been identified as potential therapeutic targets in multiple cancers, including glioblastoma (GBM) and melanoma. Aside from its tumorigenic properties, DGKα is also a known promoter of T-cell anergy, supporting a role as a recently-recognized T cell checkpoint. In fact, the only significant phenotype previously observed in Dgka knockout (KO) mice is the enhancement of T-cell activity. Herein we reveal a novel, macrophage-specific, immune-regulatory function of DGKα. In bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs) cultured from wild-type (WT) and KO mice, we observed increased responsiveness of KO macrophages to diverse stimuli that yield different phenotypes, including LPS, IL-4, and the chemoattractant MCP-1. Knockdown (KD) of Dgka in a murine macrophage cell line resulted in similar increased responsiveness. Demonstrating in vivo relevance, we observed significantly smaller wounds in Dgka-/- mice with full-thickness cutaneous burns, a complex wound healing process in which macrophages play a key role. The burned area also demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages. In a cortical stab wound model, Dgka-/- brains show increased Iba1+ cell numbers at the needle track versus that in WT brains. Taken together, these findings identify a novel immune-regulatory checkpoint function of DGKα in macrophages with potential implications for wound healing, cancer therapy, and other settings.},

The LPA locus link with cardiovascular risk exemplifies how detailed metabolic profiling may inform underlying aetiology via extensive associations with very-low-density lipoprotein and triglyceride metabolism. Genetic fine mapping and Mendelian randomization uncover wide-spread causal effects of lipoprotein(a) on overall lipoprotein metabolism and we assess potential pleiotropic consequences of genetically elevated lipoprotein(a) on diverse morbidities via electronic health-care records.

This phenomenon is named trained immunity and can improve host defense against (recurrent) infections. In contrast, trained immunity can also be maladaptive in the context of chronic inflammatory disorders, such as atherosclerosis. Key to future therapeutic exploitation of this mechanism is thorough knowledge of the mechanisms driving trained immunity, which can be used as pharmacological targets. These mechanisms include profound changes in intracellular metabolism, which are closely intertwined with epigenetic reprogramming at the level of histone modifications. Glycolysis, glutamine replenishment of the tricarboxylic acid cycle with accumulation of fumarate, and the mevalonate pathway have all been identified as critical pathways for trained immunity in monocytes and macrophages. In this review, we provide a state-of-the-art overview of how these metabolic pathways interact with epigenetic programs to develop trained immunity.},

Here, we show that BCG induction of trained immunity in monocytes is accompanied by a strong increase in glycolysis and, to a lesser extent, glutamine metabolism, both in an in-vitro model and after vaccination of mice and humans. Pharmacological and genetic modulation of rate-limiting glycolysis enzymes inhibits trained immunity, changes that are reflected by the effects on the histone marks (H3K4me3 and H3K9me3) underlying BCG-induced trained immunity. These data demonstrate that a shift of the glucose metabolism toward glycolysis is crucial for the induction of the histone modifications and functional changes underlying BCG-induced trained immunity.

Through network-level integration of transcriptomics and metabolomics data, we identify glycolysis, glutaminolysis, and the cholesterol synthesis pathway as indispensable for the induction of trained immunity by β-glucan in monocytes. Accumulation of fumarate, due to glutamine replenishment of the TCA cycle, integrates immune and metabolic circuits to induce monocyte epigenetic reprogramming by inhibiting KDM5 histone demethylases. Furthermore, fumarate itself induced an epigenetic program similar to β-glucan-induced trained immunity. In line with this, inhibition of glutaminolysis and cholesterol synthesis in mice reduced the induction of trained immunity by β-glucan. Identification of the metabolic pathways leading to induction of trained immunity contributes to our understanding of innate immune memory and opens new therapeutic avenues.},

Three papers in this issue report the identification of endogenous danger signals and bacterial components that activate inflammasomes containing cryopyrin (also known as NALP3). Mariathasan et al. show that cryopyrin activates the inflammasome in response to bacterial toxins and to ATP. Kanneganti et al. show that cryopyrin is activated by bacterial RNA and by the immune response modifiers R837 and R848. And Martinon et al. show that gout-associated uric acid crystals have a similar effect. In sum these results show that cryopyrin has a vital role in host antibacterial defences and may act as a sensor of cellular stress.

While this capacity to respond more strongly to stimuli is beneficial for host defense, in some circumstances it can lead to maladaptive programming and chronic inflammation. Gout is characterized by persistent low-grade inflammation and is associated with an increased number of comorbidities. Hyperuricemia is the main risk factor for gout and is linked to the development of comorbidities. Several experimental studies have shown that urate can mechanistically alter the inflammatory capacity of myeloid cells, while observational studies have indicated an association of hyperuricemia to a wide spectrum of common adult inflammatory diseases. In this review, we argue that hyperuricemia is a main culprit in the development of the long-term systemic inflammation seen in gout. We revisit existing evidence for urate-induced transcriptional and epigenetic reprogramming that could lead to an altered functional state of circulating monocytes consisting in enhanced responsiveness and maladaptive immune responses. By discussing specific functional adaptations of monocytes and macrophages induced by soluble urate or monosodium urate crystals and their contribution to inflammation in vitro and in vivo, we further enforce that urate is a metabolite that can induce innate immune memory and we discuss future research and possible new therapeutic approaches for gout and its comorbidities.},

However, although lacking adaptive immune responses, plants and invertebrates are protected against reinfection with pathogens, and invertebrates even display transplant rejection. In mammals, past “forgotten” studies demonstrate cross-protection between infections independently of T and B cells, and more recently memory properties for NK cells and macrophages, prototypical cells of innate immunity, have been described. We now posit that mammalian innate immunity also exhibits an immunological memory of past insults, for which we propose the term “trained immunity.” Understanding trained immunity will revolutionize our view of host defense and immunological memory, and could lead to defining a new class of vaccines and immunotherapies.},

Innate immunity also plays pivotal roles in injury-induced tissue remodeling and the maintenance of tissue homeostasis in physiological and pathological conditions. Lipid metabolites are emerging as the key players in the regulation of innate immune responses, and recent work has highlighted the importance of the lipid metabolite palmitate as an essential component in this regulation. Palmitate modulates innate immunity not only by regulating the activation of pattern recognition receptors in local innate immune cells, but also via coordinating immunological activity in inflammatory tissues. Moreover, protein palmitoylation controls various cellular physiological processes. Herein, we review the updated evidence that palmitate catabolism contributes to innate immune cell-mediated inflammatory processes that result in immunometabolic disorders.},

Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) have identified sequence variants for CKD; however, the biological basis of these GWAS results remains poorly understood. To address this issue, we created an expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) atlas for the glomerular and tubular compartments of the human kidney. Through integrating the CKD GWAS with eQTL, single-cell RNA sequencing and regulatory region maps, we identified novel genes for CKD. Putative causal genes were enriched for proximal tubule expression and endolysosomal function, where DAB2, an adaptor protein in the TGF-β pathway, formed a central node. Functional experiments confirmed that reducing Dab2 expression in renal tubules protected mice from CKD. In conclusion, compartment-specific eQTL analysis is an important avenue for the identification of novel genes and cellular pathways involved in CKD development and thus potential new opportunities for its treatment.},

Here, using genome-wide transcriptomic analysis and biochemical assays, we demonstrate that MSUc alone induce a metabolic-inflammatory transcriptional program in non-primed human and murine macrophages that is markedly distinct to that induced by LPS. Genes uniquely upregulated in response to MSUc belong to lipid and amino acid metabolism, glycolysis, and SLC transporters. This upregulation leads to a metabolic rewiring in sera from individuals and mice with acute gouty arthritis. Mechanistically, the initiating inflammatory-metabolic changes in acute gout flares are regulated through a persistent expression and increased binding of JUN to the promoter of target genes through JNK signaling—but not P38—in a process that is different than after LPS stimulation and independent of inflammasome activation. Finally, pharmacological JNK inhibition limits MSUc-induced inflammation in animal models of acute gouty inflammation.},

Metabolic pathways for biosynthesis and degradation tightly control the turnover rate, concentration, and molecular size of hyaluronan in tissues. Despite the relatively simple chemical composition of this polysaccharide, its wide range of molecular weights mediate diverse functions that depend on molecular size and tissue concentration. Genetic engineering and pharmacological approaches have demonstrated close associations between hyaluronan metabolism and functions in many physiological and pathological events, including morphogenesis, wound healing, and inflammation. Moreover, emerging evidence has suggested that the accumulation of hyaluronan extracellular matrix and fragments due to the altered expression of hyaluronan synthases and hyaluronidases potentiates cancer development and progression by remodeling the tumor microenvironment. In addition to the well-known functions exerted by extracellular hyaluronan, recent metabolomic approaches have also revealed that its synthesis can regulate cellular functions via the reprogramming of cellular metabolism. This review highlights the current advances in knowledge on the biosynthesis and catabolism of hyaluronan and describes the diverse functions associated with hyaluronan metabolism.},

	abstract = {Objective To determine whether a gout polygenic risk score (PRS) is associated with age at gout onset and tophaceous disease in European, East Polynesian, and West Polynesian men and women with gout. Methods A 19-variant gout PRS was produced in 7 European gout cohorts (N = 4,016), 2 East Polynesian gout cohorts (N = 682), and 1 West Polynesian gout cohort (N = 490). Sex-stratified regression models were used to estimate the relationship between the PRS and age at gout onset and tophaceous disease. Results The PRS was associated with earlier age at gout onset in men (β = –3.61 in years per unit PRS [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) –4.32, –2.90] in European men; β = –6.35 [95\% CI –8.91, –3.80] in East Polynesian men; β = –3.51 [95\% CI –5.46, –1.57] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (β = 0.07 [95\% CI –2.32, 2.45] in European women; β = 0.20 [95\% CI –7.21, 7.62] in East Polynesian women; β –3.33 [95\% CI –9.28, 2.62] in West Polynesian women). The PRS showed a positive association with tophaceous disease in men (odds ratio [OR] for the association 1.15 [95\% CI 1.00, 1.31] in European men; OR 2.60 [95\% CI 1.66, 4.06] in East Polynesian men; OR 1.53 [95\% CI 1.07, 2.19] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (OR for the association 0.68 [95\% CI 0.42, 1.10] in European women; OR 1.45 [95\% CI 0.39, 5.36] in East Polynesian women). The PRS association with age at gout onset was robust to the removal of ABCG2 variants from the PRS in European and East Polynesian men (β = –2.42 [95\% CI –3.37, –1.46] and β = –6.80 [95\% CI –10.06, –3.55], respectively) but not in West Polynesian men (β = –1.79 [95\% CI –4.74, 1.16]). Conclusion Genetic risk variants for gout also harbor risk for earlier age at gout onset and tophaceous disease in European and Polynesian men. Our findings suggest that earlier gout onset involves the accumulation of gout risk alleles in men but perhaps not in women, and that this genetic risk is shared across multiple ancestral groups.},

Loci identified using this approach (including SLC2A9 and ABCG2, the strongest urate-associated loci) are proposed to be involved in the progression from hyperuricaemia to gout [1–3]. We hypothesize that these associations could reflect the role of these loci in urate control. We therefore predict that: (i) the greater the serum urate threshold for controls, the smaller the estimated gout genetic associations should be and (ii) in a general population, adjustment for serum urate should eliminate the association of these variants with gout.},

	abstract = {Gout is of particularly high prevalence in the Māori and Pacific (Polynesian) populations of Aotearoa New Zealand (NZ). Here, we investigated the contribution of common population-specific copy number variation (CNV) to gout in the Aotearoa NZ Polynesian population. Microarray-generated genome-wide genotype data from Aotearoa NZ Polynesian individuals with (n = 1196) and without (n = 1249) gout were analyzed. Comparator population groups were 552 individuals of European ancestry and 1962 of Han Chinese ancestry. Levels of circulating major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I polypeptide-related sequence A (MICA) were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Fifty-four CNV regions (CNVRs) appearing in at least 10 individuals were detected, of which seven common (\&gt;2\%) CNVRs were specific to or amplified in Polynesian people. A burden test of these seven revealed associations of insertion/deletion with gout (odds ratio (OR) 95\% confidence interval [CI] = 1.80 [1.01; 3.22], P = 0.046). Individually testing of the seven CNVRs for association with gout revealed nominal association of CNVR1 with gout in Western Polynesian (Chr6: 31.36–31.45 Mb, OR = 1.72 [1.03; 2.92], P = 0.04), CNVR6 in the meta-analyzed Polynesian sample sets (Chr1: 196.75–196.92 Mb, OR = 1.86 [1.16; 3.00], P = 0.01) and CNVR9 in Western Polynesian (Chr1: 189.35–189.54 Mb, OR = 2.75 [1.15; 7.13], P = 0.03). Analysis of European gout genetic association data demonstrated a signal of association at the CNVR1 locus that was an expression quantitative trait locus for MICA. The most common CNVR (CNVR1) includes deletion of the MICA gene, encoding an immunomodulatory protein. Expression of MICA was reduced in the serum of individuals with the deletion. In summary, we provide evidence for the association of CNVR1 containing MICA with gout in Polynesian people, implicating class I MHC-mediated antigen presentation in gout.},

Substantial efforts are now devoted to biobank projects to collect large genetic and phenotypic data, providing unprecedented opportunity for genetic discovery and applications. To process the large-scale data provided by such biobank resources, highly efficient and scalable methods and software are required.Here we introduce PRSice-2, an efficient and scalable software program for automating and simplifying PRS analyses on large-scale data. PRSice-2 handles both genotyped and imputed data, provides empirical association P-values free from inflation due to overfitting, supports different inheritance models, and can evaluate multiple continuous and binary target traits simultaneously. We demonstrate that PRSice-2 is dramatically faster and more memory-efficient than PRSice-1 and alternative PRS software, LDpred and lassosum, while having comparable predictive power.PRSice-2's combination of efficiency and power will be increasingly important as data sizes grow and as the applications of PRS become more sophisticated, e.g., when incorporated into high-dimensional or gene set–based analyses. PRSice-2 is written in C++, with an R script for plotting, and is freely available for download from http://PRSice.info.},

Enzymes of the kynurenine pathway are expressed in different tissues and cell types throughout the body and are regulated by cues, including nutritional and inflammatory signals. As a consequence of this systemic metabolic integration, peripheral inflammation can contribute to accumulation of kynurenine in the brain, which has been associated with depression and schizophrenia. Conversely, kynurenine accumulation can be suppressed by activating kynurenine clearance in exercised skeletal muscle. The effect of exercise training on depression through modulation of the kynurenine pathway highlights an important mechanism of interorgan cross-talk mediated by these metabolites. Here, we discuss peripheral mechanisms of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism and their effects on inflammatory, metabolic, oncologic, and psychiatric disorders.},

	abstract = {Kidney diseases have become one of the most common health care problems. Due to a growing number of advanced aged patients with concomitant disorders the prevalence of these diseases will increase over the coming decades. Despite available laboratory tests, accurate and rapid diagnosis of renal dysfunction has yet to be realized, and prognosis is uncertain. Moreover, data on diagnostic and prognostic markers in kidney diseases are lacking. The kynurenine (KYN) pathway is one of the routes of tryptophan (Trp) degradation, with biologically active substances presenting ambiguous properties. The KYN pathway is known to be highly dependent on immunological system activity. As the kidneys are one of the main organs involved in the formation, degradation and excretion of Trp end products, pathologies involving the kidneys result in KYN pathway activity disturbances. This review aims to summarize changes in the KYN pathway observed in the most common kidney disease, chronic kidney disease (CKD), with a special focus on diabetic kidney disease, acute kidney injury (AKI), glomerulonephritis and kidney graft function monitoring. Additionally, the importance of KYN pathway activity in kidney cancer pathogenesis is discussed, as are available pharmacological agents affecting KYN pathway activity in the kidney. Despite limited clinical data, the KYN pathway appears to be a promising target in the diagnosis and prognosis of kidney diseases. Modulation of KYN pathway activity by pharmacological agents should be considered in the treatment of kidney diseases.},

We detected urine-specific findings that provide information about metabolite reabsorption in the kidney, such as aquaporin (AQP)-7-mediated glycerol transport, and different metabolomic footprints of kidney-expressed proteins in plasma and urine that are consistent with their localization and function, including the transporters NaDC3 (SLC13A3) and ASBT (SLC10A2). Shared genetic determinants of 7,073 metabolite–disease combinations represent a resource to better understand metabolic diseases and revealed connections of dipeptidase 1 with circulating digestive enzymes and with hypertension.

	abstract = {Objective To determine whether a gout polygenic risk score (PRS) is associated with age at gout onset and tophaceous disease in European, East Polynesian, and West Polynesian men and women with gout. Methods A 19-variant gout PRS was produced in 7 European gout cohorts (N = 4,016), 2 East Polynesian gout cohorts (N = 682), and 1 West Polynesian gout cohort (N = 490). Sex-stratified regression models were used to estimate the relationship between the PRS and age at gout onset and tophaceous disease. Results The PRS was associated with earlier age at gout onset in men (β = –3.61 in years per unit PRS [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) –4.32, –2.90] in European men; β = –6.35 [95\% CI –8.91, –3.80] in East Polynesian men; β = –3.51 [95\% CI –5.46, –1.57] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (β = 0.07 [95\% CI –2.32, 2.45] in European women; β = 0.20 [95\% CI –7.21, 7.62] in East Polynesian women; β –3.33 [95\% CI –9.28, 2.62] in West Polynesian women). The PRS showed a positive association with tophaceous disease in men (odds ratio [OR] for the association 1.15 [95\% CI 1.00, 1.31] in European men; OR 2.60 [95\% CI 1.66, 4.06] in East Polynesian men; OR 1.53 [95\% CI 1.07, 2.19] in West Polynesian men) but not in women (OR for the association 0.68 [95\% CI 0.42, 1.10] in European women; OR 1.45 [95\% CI 0.39, 5.36] in East Polynesian women). The PRS association with age at gout onset was robust to the removal of ABCG2 variants from the PRS in European and East Polynesian men (β = –2.42 [95\% CI –3.37, –1.46] and β = –6.80 [95\% CI –10.06, –3.55], respectively) but not in West Polynesian men (β = –1.79 [95\% CI –4.74, 1.16]). Conclusion Genetic risk variants for gout also harbor risk for earlier age at gout onset and tophaceous disease in European and Polynesian men. Our findings suggest that earlier gout onset involves the accumulation of gout risk alleles in men but perhaps not in women, and that this genetic risk is shared across multiple ancestral groups.},

Presently, blood samples have been collected from over 800,000 enrolled participants. The size and diversity of the MVP cohort, as well as the availability of extensive VA electronic health records, make it a promising resource for precision medicine. MVP is conducting array-based genotyping to provide a genome-wide scan of the entire cohort, in parallel with whole-genome sequencing, methylation, and other ‘omics assays. Here, we present the design and performance of the MVP 1.0 custom Axiom array, which was designed and developed as a single assay to be used across the multi-ethnic MVP cohort. A unified genetic quality-control analysis was developed and conducted on an initial tranche of 485,856 individuals, leading to a high-quality dataset of 459,777 unique individuals. 668,418 genetic markers passed quality control and showed high-quality genotypes not only on common variants but also on rare variants. We confirmed that, with non-European individuals making up nearly 30\%, MVP’s substantial ancestral diversity surpasses that of other large biobanks. We also demonstrated the quality of the MVP dataset by replicating established genetic associations with height in European Americans and African Americans ancestries. This current dataset has been made available to approved MVP researchers for genome-wide association studies and other downstream analyses. Further data releases will be available for analysis as recruitment at the VA continues and the cohort expands both in size and diversity.},

Methods Serum samples from 330 participants, including 109 with gout, 102 with asymptomatic hyperuricemia, and 119 normouricemic controls, were analyzed by high-resolution mass spectrometry–based metabolomics. Multivariate principal components analysis and orthogonal partial least squares discriminant analysis were performed to explore differential metabolites and pathways. A multivariate methods with Unbiased Variable selection in R (MUVR) algorithm was performed to identify potential biomarkers and build multivariate diagnostic models using 3 machine learning algorithms: random forest, support vector machine, and logistic regression. Results Univariate analysis demonstrated that there was a greater difference between the metabolic profiles of patients with gout and normouricemic controls than between the metabolic profiles of individuals with hyperuricemia and normouricemic controls, while gout and hyperuricemia showed clear metabolomic differences. Pathway enrichment analysis found diverse significantly dysregulated pathways in individuals with hyperuricemia and patients with gout compared to normouricemic controls, among which arginine metabolism appeared to play a critical role. The multivariate diagnostic model using MUVR found 13 metabolites as potential biomarkers to differentiate hyperuricemia and gout from normouricemia. Two-thirds of the samples were randomly selected as a training set, and the remainder were used as a validation set. Receiver operating characteristic analysis of 7 metabolites yielded an area under the curve of 0.83–0.87 in the training set and 0.78–0.84 in the validation set for distinguishing gout from asymptomatic hyperuricemia by 3 machine learning algorithms. Conclusion Gout and hyperuricemia have distinct serum metabolomic signatures. This diagnostic model has the potential to improve current gout care through early detection or prediction of progression to gout from hyperuricemia.},

Using data from 85,760 individuals with activity-monitor derived measures of sleep timing we find that the chronotype loci associate with sleep timing: the mean sleep timing of the 5\% of individuals carrying the most morningness alleles is 25 min earlier than the 5\% carrying the fewest. The loci are enriched for genes involved in circadian regulation, cAMP, glutamate and insulin signalling pathways, and those expressed in the retina, hindbrain, hypothalamus, and pituitary. Using Mendelian Randomisation, we show that being a morning person is causally associated with better mental health but does not affect BMI or risk of Type 2 diabetes. This study offers insights into circadian biology and its links to disease in humans.},

	abstract = {It is challenging to quickly diagnose slowly progressing diseases. To prioritize multiple related diagnoses, we developed G-PROB (Genetic Probability tool) to calculate the probability of different diseases for a patient using genetic risk scores. We tested G-PROB for inflammatory arthritis–causing diseases (rheumatoid arthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, spondyloarthropathy, psoriatic arthritis, and gout). After validating on simulated data, we tested G-PROB in three cohorts: 1211 patients identified by International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes within the eMERGE database, 245 patients identified through ICD codes and medical record review within the Partners Biobank, and 243 patients first presenting with unexplained inflammatory arthritis and with final diagnoses by record review within the Partners Biobank. Calibration of G-probabilities with disease status was high, with regression coefficients from 0.90 to 1.08 (1.00 is ideal). G-probabilities discriminated true diagnoses across the three cohorts with pooled areas under the curve (95\% CI) of 0.69 (0.67 to 0.71), 0.81 (0.76 to 0.84), and 0.84 (0.81 to 0.86), respectively. For all patients, at least one disease could be ruled out, and in 45\% of patients, a likely diagnosis was identified with a 64\% positive predictive value. In 35\% of cases, the clinician’s initial diagnosis was incorrect. Initial clinical diagnosis explained 39\% of the variance in final disease, which improved to 51\% (P {\textless} 0.0001) after adding G-probabilities. Converting genotype information before a clinical visit into an interpretable probability value for five different inflammatory arthritides could potentially be used to improve the diagnostic efficiency of rheumatic diseases in clinical practice.},

Here we present an overview of CSF1 biology, including evolution, regulation and functions of cell surface and secreted isoforms. CSF1 is widely-expressed, primarily by cells of mesenchymal lineages, in all mouse tissues. Cell-specific deletion of a floxed Csf1 allele in mice indicates that local CSF1 production contributes to the maintenance of tissue-specific macrophage populations but is not saturating. CSF1 in the circulation is controlled primarily by receptor-mediated clearance by macrophages in liver and spleen. Administration of recombinant CSF1 to humans or animals leads to monocytosis and expansion of tissue macrophage populations and growth of the liver and spleen. In a wide variety of tissue injury models, CSF1 administration promotes monocyte infiltration, clearance of damaged cells and repair. We suggest that CSF1 has therapeutic potential in regenerative medicine.},

The GWAS method is commonly applied within the social sciences. However, statistical analyses will need to be carefully conducted and the use of dedicated genetics software will be required. This tutorial aims to provide a guideline for conducting genetic analyses. Methods We discuss and explain key concepts and illustrate how to conduct GWAS using example scripts provided through GitHub (https://github.com/MareesAT/GWA\_tutorial/). In addition to the illustration of standard GWAS, we will also show how to apply polygenic risk score (PRS) analysis. PRS does not aim to identify individual SNPs but aggregates information from SNPs across the genome in order to provide individual-level scores of genetic risk. Results The simulated data and scripts that will be illustrated in the current tutorial provide hands-on practice with genetic analyses. The scripts are based on PLINK, PRSice, and R, which are commonly used, freely available software tools that are accessible for novice users. Conclusions By providing theoretical background and hands-on experience, we aim to make GWAS more accessible to researchers without formal training in the field.},

We conducted a genome-wide cytosine methylation analysis of 399 human kidney samples, along with single-nuclear open chromatin analysis on over 60,000 cells from 14 subjects, including controls, and diabetes and hypertension attributed chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients. We identified and validated differentially methylated positions associated with disease states, and discovered that nearly 30\% of these alterations were influenced by underlying genetic variations, including variants known to be associated with kidney disease in genome-wide association studies. We also identified regions showing both methylation and open chromatin changes. These changes in methylation and open chromatin significantly associated gene expression changes, most notably those playing role in metabolism and expressed in proximal tubules. Our study further demonstrated that methylation risk scores (MRS) can improve disease state annotation and prediction of kidney disease development. Collectively, our results suggest a causal relationship between epigenetic changes and kidney disease pathogenesis, thereby providing potential pathways for the development of novel risk stratification methods.},

	abstract = {Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a heterogeneous disease that develops through diverse pathophysiological processes1,2 and molecular mechanisms that are often specific to cell type3,4. Here, to characterize the genetic contribution to these processes across ancestry groups, we aggregate genome-wide association study data from 2,535,601 individuals (39.7\% not of European ancestry), including 428,452 cases of T2D. We identify 1,289 independent association signals at genome-wide significance (P {\textless} 5 × 10−8) that map to 611 loci, of which 145 loci are, to our knowledge, previously unreported. We define eight non-overlapping clusters of T2D signals that are characterized by distinct profiles of cardiometabolic trait associations. These clusters are differentially enriched for cell-type-specific regions of open chromatin, including pancreatic islets, adipocytes, endothelial cells and enteroendocrine cells. We build cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores5 in a further 279,552 individuals of diverse ancestry, including 30,288 cases of T2D, and test their association with T2D-related vascular outcomes. Cluster-specific partitioned polygenic scores are associated with coronary artery disease, peripheral artery disease and end-stage diabetic nephropathy across ancestry groups, highlighting the importance of obesity-related processes in the development of vascular outcomes. Our findings show the value of integrating multi-ancestry genome-wide association study data with single-cell epigenomics to disentangle the aetiological heterogeneity that drives the development and progression of T2D. This might offer a route to optimize global access to genetically informed diabetes care.},

Our optimal combined S2G strategy (cS2G) included seven constituent S2G strategies and achieved a precision of 0.75 and a recall of 0.33, more than doubling the recall of any individual strategy. We applied cS2G to fine-mapping results for 49 UK Biobank diseases/traits to predict 5,095 causal SNP–gene-disease triplets (with S2G-derived functional interpretation) with high confidence. We further applied cS2G to provide an empirical assessment of disease omnigenicity; we determined that the top 1\% of genes explained roughly half of the SNP heritability linked to all genes and that gene-level architectures vary with variant allele frequency.},

The utility of metabolomics, integrated with transcriptomics and disease GWASs, to understand molecular mechanisms for metabolite levels or diseases has not been thoroughly evaluated. We performed probabilistic transcriptome-wide association and locus-level colocalization analyses to integrate transcriptomics results for 49 tissues in 706 individuals from the GTEx project, metabolomics results for 1,391 plasma metabolites in 6,136 Finnish men from the METSIM study, and GWAS results for 2,861 disease traits in 260,405 Finnish individuals from the FinnGen study. We found that genetic variants that regulate metabolite levels were more likely to influence gene expression and disease risk compared to the ones that do not. Integrating transcriptomics with metabolomics results prioritized 397 genes for 521 metabolites, including 496 previously identified gene-metabolite pairs with strong functional connections and suggested 33.3\% of such gene-metabolite pairs shared the same causal variants with genetic associations of gene expression. Integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics individually with FinnGen GWAS results identified 1,597 genes for 790 disease traits. Integrating transcriptomics and metabolomics jointly with FinnGen GWAS results helped pinpoint metabolic pathways from genes to diseases. We identified putative causal effects of UGT1A1/UGT1A4 expression on gallbladder disorders through regulating plasma (E,E)-bilirubin levels, of SLC22A5 expression on nasal polyps and plasma carnitine levels through distinct pathways, and of LIPC expression on age-related macular degeneration through glycerophospholipid metabolic pathways. Our study highlights the power of integrating multiple sets of molecular traits and GWAS results to deepen understanding of disease pathophysiology.},

To address these challenges, the National Human Genome Research Institute-funded Electronic Medical Records and Genomics (eMERGE) Network has developed a framework and pipeline for return of a PRS-based genome-informed risk assessment to 25,000 diverse adults and children as part of a clinical study. From an initial list of 23 conditions, ten were selected for implementation based on PRS performance, medical actionability and potential clinical utility, including cardiometabolic diseases and cancer. Standardized metrics were considered in the selection process, with additional consideration given to strength of evidence in African and Hispanic populations. We then developed a pipeline for clinical PRS implementation (score transfer to a clinical laboratory, validation and verification of score performance), and used genetic ancestry to calibrate PRS mean and variance, utilizing genetically diverse data from 13,475 participants of the All of Us Research Program cohort to train and test model parameters. Finally, we created a framework for regulatory compliance and developed a PRS clinical report for return to providers and for inclusion in an additional genome-informed risk assessment. The initial experience from eMERGE can inform the approach needed to implement PRS-based testing in diverse clinical settings.},

We further measured the orotate level in a separate cohort and demonstrated that, consistent with MR, orotate levels were positively associated with incident hip fractures.

Here, we demonstrate in macrophages and B cells that collaborative interactions of the common factor PU.1 with small sets of macrophage- or B cell lineage-determining transcription factors establish cell-specific binding sites that are associated with the majority of promoter-distal H3K4me1-marked genomic regions. PU.1 binding initiates nucleosome remodeling, followed by H3K4 monomethylation at large numbers of genomic regions associated with both broadly and specifically expressed genes. These locations serve as beacons for additional factors, exemplified by liver X receptors, which drive both cell-specific gene expression and signal-dependent responses. Together with analyses of transcription factor binding and H3K4me1 patterns in other cell types, these studies suggest that simple combinations of lineage-determining transcription factors can specify the genomic sites ultimately responsible for both cell identity and cell type-specific responses to diverse signaling inputs.},

	abstract = {Horizontal integration of summary statistics from different GWAS traits can be used to evaluate evidence for their shared genetic causality. One popular method to do this is a Bayesian method, coloc, which is attractive in requiring only GWAS summary statistics and no linkage disequilibrium estimates and is now being used routinely to perform thousands of comparisons between traits. Here we show that while most users do not adjust default software values, misspecification of prior parameters can substantially alter posterior inference. We suggest data driven methods to derive sensible prior values, and demonstrate how sensitivity analysis can be used to assess robustness of posterior inference. The flexibility of coloc comes at the expense of an unrealistic assumption of a single causal variant per trait. This assumption can be relaxed by stepwise conditioning, but this requires external software and an LD matrix aligned to study alleles. We have now implemented conditioning within coloc, and propose a new alternative method, masking, that does not require LD and approximates conditioning when causal variants are independent. Importantly, masking can be used in combination with conditioning where allelically aligned LD estimates are available for only a single trait. We have implemented these developments in a new version of coloc which we hope will enable more informed choice of priors and overcome the restriction of the single causal variant assumptions in coloc analysis.},

To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2×10−201), ABCG2 (p = 3.1×10−26), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0×10−14), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7×10−14), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0×10−9), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1×10−8), GCKR (p = 1.4×10−9), LRRC16A (p = 8.5×10−9), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7×10−9). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women. To further characterize the identified variants, we analyzed their association with a panel of metabolites. rs12356193 within SLC16A9 was associated with DL-carnitine (p = 4.0×10−26) and propionyl-L-carnitine (p = 5.0×10−8) concentrations, which in turn were associated with serum UA levels (p = 1.4×10−57 and p = 8.1×10−54, respectively), forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites, and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight additional pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia. In addition, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport proteins are key in regulating serum uric acid levels.},

Such a quantitative evaluation is necessary to clarify the ethical concerns related to data sharing and to enable efficient use of human genetic information in stool samples, such as for research and forensics. Here we used genomic approaches to reconstruct personal information from the faecal metagenomes of 343 Japanese individuals with associated human genotype data. Genetic sex could be accurately predicted based on the sequencing depth of sex chromosomes for 97.3\% of the samples. Individuals could be re-identified from the matched genotype data based on human reads recovered from the faecal metagenomic data with 93.3\% sensitivity using a likelihood score-based method. This method also enabled us to predict the ancestries of 98.3\% of the samples. Finally, we performed ultra-deep shotgun metagenomic sequencing of five faecal samples as well as whole-genome sequencing of blood samples. Using genotype-calling approaches, we demonstrated that the genotypes of both common and rare variants could be reconstructed from faecal samples. This included clinically relevant variants. Our approach can be used to quantify personal information contained within gut metagenome data.},

	abstract = {Lysophosphatidylcholines are a group of bioactive lipids heavily investigated in the context of inflammation and atherosclerosis development. While present in plasma during physiological conditions, their concentration can drastically increase in certain inflammatory states. Lysophosphatidylcholines are widely regarded as potent pro-inflammatory and deleterious mediators, but an increasing number of more recent studies show multiple beneficial properties under various pathological conditions. Many of the discrepancies in the published studies are due to the investigation of different species or mixtures of lysophatidylcholines and the use of supra-physiological concentrations in the absence of serum or other carrier proteins. Furthermore, interpretation of the results is complicated by the rapid metabolism of lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) in cells and tissues to pro-inflammatory lysophosphatidic acid. Interestingly, most of the recent studies, in contrast to older studies, found lower LPC plasma levels associated with unfavorable disease outcomes. Being the most abundant lysophospholipid in plasma, it is of utmost importance to understand its physiological functions and shed light on the discordant literature connected to its research. LPCs should be recognized as important homeostatic mediators involved in all stages of vascular inflammation. In this review, we want to point out potential pro- and anti-inflammatory activities of lysophospholipids in the vascular system and highlight recent discoveries about the effect of lysophosphatidylcholines on immune cells at the endothelial vascular interface. We will also look at their potential clinical application as biomarkers.},

	abstract = {BackgroundLysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) is the main phospholipid component of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL) and is usually noted as a marker of several human diseases, such as atherosclerosis, cancer and diabetes. Some studies suggest that oxLDL modulates Toll-like receptor (TLR) signaling. However, effector molecules that are present in oxLDL particles and can trigger TLR signaling are not yet clear. LPC was previously described as an attenuator of sepsis and as an immune suppressor. In the present study, we have evaluated the role of LPC as a dual modulator of the TLR-mediated signaling pathway. Methodology/Principal FindingsHEK 293A cells were transfected with TLR expression constructs and stimulated with LPC molecules with different fatty acid chain lengths and saturation levels. All LPC molecules activated both TLR4 and TLR2-1 signaling, as evaluated by NF-қB activation and IL-8 production. These data were confirmed by Western blot analysis of NF-қB translocation in isolated nuclei of peritoneal murine macrophages. However, LPC counteracted the TLR4 signaling induced by LPS. In this case, NF-қB translocation, nitric oxide (NO) synthesis and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were blocked. Moreover, LPC activated the MAP Kinases p38 and JNK, but not ERK, in murine macrophages. Interestingly, LPC blocked LPS-induced ERK activation in peritoneal macrophages but not in TLR-transfected cells. Conclusions/SignificanceThe above results indicate that LPC is a dual-activity ligand molecule. It is able to trigger a classical proinflammatory phenotype by activating TLR4- and TLR2-1-mediated signaling. However, in the presence of classical TLR ligands, LPC counteracts some of the TLR-mediated intracellular responses, ultimately inducing an anti-inflammatory phenotype; LPC may thus play a role in the regulation of cell immune responses and disease progression.},

Furthermore, products of 12-lipoxygenase activity increase in monocytes of healthy individuals after BCG vaccination.

Multiple immune receptor types rewire metabolic pathways as a key part of how they promote effector functions. Perhaps surprisingly for immunologists, the Krebs cycle has emerged as the central immunometabolic hub of the macrophage. During proinflammatory macrophage activation, there is an accumulation of the Krebs cycle intermediates succinate and citrate, and the Krebs cycle–derived metabolite itaconate. These metabolites have distinct nonmetabolic signaling roles that influence inflammatory gene expression. A key bioenergetic target for the Krebs cycle, the electron transport chain, also becomes altered, generating reactive oxygen species from Complexes I and III. Similarly, alternatively activated macrophages require α-ketoglutarate-dependent epigenetic reprogramming to elicit anti-inflammatory gene expression. In this review, we discuss these advances and speculate on the possibility of targeting these events therapeutically for inflammatory diseases.},

Recent findings describe the adaptive characteristics of the innate immune system, underscored by its ability to remember antecedent foreign encounters and respond in a nonspecific sensitized manner to reinfection. This has been termed trained innate immunity. Although beneficial in the context of recurrent infections, this might actually contribute to chronic immune-mediated diseases, such as atherosclerosis.Recent Advances: In line with its proposed role in sustaining cellular memories, epigenetic reprogramming has emerged as a critical determinant of trained immunity. Recent technological and computational advances that improve unbiased acquisition of epigenomic profiles have significantly enhanced our appreciation for the complexities of chromatin architecture in the contexts of diverse immunological challenges.Critical Issues: Key to resolving the distinct chromatin signatures of innate immune memory is a comprehensive understanding of the precise physiological targets of regulatory proteins that recognize, deposit, and remove chemical modifications from chromatin as well as other gene-regulating factors. Drawing from a rapidly expanding compendium of experimental and clinical studies, this review details a current perspective of the epigenetic pathways that support the adapted phenotypes of monocytes and macrophages.Future Directions: We explore future strategies that are aimed at exploiting the mechanism of trained immunity to improve the prevention and treatment of infections and immune-mediated chronic disorders.},

Knockdown of FH and SDH results in elevated intracellular levels of fumarate and succinate, respectively, which act as competitors of α-KG to broadly inhibit the activity of α-KG-dependent dioxygenases. In addition, ectopic expression of tumor-derived FH and SDH mutants inhibits histone demethylation and hydroxylation of 5mC. Our study suggests that tumor-derived FH and SDH mutations accumulate fumarate and succinate, leading to enzymatic inhibition of multiple α-KG-dependent dioxygenases and consequent alterations of genome-wide histone and DNA methylation.

Epigenetic reprogramming was accompanied by functional changes indicative of trained immunity. Reduction of viremia was highly correlated with the upregulation of IL-1β, a heterologous cytokine associated with the induction of trained immunity, but not with the specific IFNγ response.

	abstract = {Objective Macrophage activation by monosodium urate (MSU) and calcium pyrophosphate (CPP) crystals mediates an interleukin (IL)-1β-dependent inflammation during gout and pseudo-gout flare, respectively. Since metabolic reprogramming of macrophages goes along with inflammatory responses dependently on stimuli and tissue environment, we aimed to decipher the role of glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation in the IL-1β-induced microcrystal response.
Methods Briefly, an in vitro study (metabolomics and real-time extracellular flux analysis) on MSU and CPP crystal-stimulated macrophages was performed to demonstrate the metabolic phenotype of macrophages. Then, the role of aerobic glycolysis in IL-1β production was evaluated, as well in vitro as in vivo using 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography imaging and glucose uptake assay, and molecular approach of glucose transporter 1 (GLUT1) inhibition.
Results We observed that MSU and CPP crystals led to a metabolic rewiring toward the aerobic glycolysis pathway explained by an increase in GLUT1 plasma membrane expression and glucose uptake on macrophages. Also, neutrophils isolated from human synovial fluid during gout flare expressed GLUT1 at their plasma membrane more frequently than neutrophils isolated from bloodstream. Both glucose deprivation and treatment with either 2-deoxyglucose or GLUT1 inhibitor suppressed crystal-induced NLRP3 activation and IL-1β production, and microcrystal inflammation in vivo.
Conclusion In conclusion, we demonstrated that GLUT1-mediated glucose uptake is instrumental during the inflammatory IL-1β response induced by MSU and CPP crystals. These findings open new therapeutic paths to modulate crystal-related inflammation.},

	abstract = {Objective To prospectively investigate population-based metabolomics for incident gout and reproduce the findings for recurrent flares, accounting for serum urate. Methods We conducted a prediagnostic metabolome-wide analysis among 105,615 UK Biobank participants with nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomic profiling data (168 total metabolites) from baseline blood samples collected 2006–2010 in those without history of gout. We calculated hazard ratios (HRs) for incident gout, adjusted for gout risk factors, excluding and including serum urate levels, overall and according to fasting duration before sample collection. Potential causal effects were tested with 2-sample Mendelian randomization. Poisson regression was used to calculate rate ratios (RRs) for the association with recurrent flares among incident gout cases. Results Correcting for multiple testing, 88 metabolites were associated with risk of incident gout (N = 1,303 cases) before serum urate adjustment, including glutamine and glycine (inversely), and lipids, branched-chain amino acids, and most prominently, glycoprotein acetyls (GlycA; P = 9.17 × 10−32). Only GlycA remained associated with incident gout following urate adjustment (HR 1.52 [95\% confidence interval (95\% CI) 1.22–1.88] between extreme quintiles); the HR increased progressively with fasting duration before sample collection, reaching 4.01 (95\% CI 1.36–11.82) for ≥8 hours of fasting. Corresponding HRs per SD change in GlycA levels were 1.10 (95\% CI 1.04–1.17) overall and 1.54 (95\% CI 1.21–1.96) for ≥8 hours of fasting. GlycA levels were also associated with recurrent gout flares among incident gout cases (RR 1.90 [95\% CI 1.27–2.85] between extreme quintiles) with larger associations with fasting. Mendelian randomization corroborated a potential causal role for GlycA on gout risk. Conclusion This prospective, population-based study implicates GlycA, a stable long-term biomarker reflecting neutrophil overactivity, in incident and recurrent gout flares (central manifestation from neutrophilic synovitis) beyond serum urate.},

	abstract = {The analysis of metabolite mediators has allowed a broader understanding of disease mechanisms. Experimental evidence indicates that metabolic rewiring is a key feature of inflammatory cells to restore tissue homeostasis upon damage. Over the last two decades, next-generation sequencing techniques have offered the possibility of looking at the genome-wide effect of the exposure of inflammatory cells to external stimuli. During gout flares, monosodium urate crystals activate a distinct metabolic profile and inflammatory transcriptional program in inflammatory cells. The extracellular signals are transduced through distinct signalling pathways, which are regulated by non-coding RNA and DNA sequences, and modification of histones. During response to inflammatory stimuli, changes in the abundance of metabolic mediators can regulate the activation of histones and of chromatin remodellers. The interplay between metabolic changes by MSUc, the regulation of epigenetic changes and the activation of transcription factor networks in inflammatory cells remains unknown. A better understanding of the interplay between metabolites and how it alters inflammatory response may provide novel insights into disease mechanisms during gout. In this review, we aim to provide a deeper understanding of the current view of how metabolic deregulation could alter the epigenetic landscape of inflammatory cells during gout.},

We found that Toll-like receptor (TLR) activation enhances choline uptake by macrophages and microglia through induction of the choline transporter CTL1. Inhibition of CTL1 expression or choline phosphorylation attenuated NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β and IL-18 production in stimulated macrophages. Mechanistically, reduced choline uptake altered mitochondrial lipid profile, attenuated mitochondrial ATP synthesis, and activated the energy sensor AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK). By potentiating mitochondrial recruitment of DRP1, AMPK stimulates mitophagy, which contributes to termination of NLRP3 inflammasome activation. Correspondingly, choline kinase inhibitors ameliorated acute and chronic models of IL-1β-dependent inflammation.},

The core functionality is to implement the inverse-variance weighted, MR-Egger and weighted median methods for multiple genetic variants. Several options are available to the user, such as the use of robust regression, fixed- or random-effects models and the penalization of weights for genetic variants with heterogeneous causal estimates. Extensions to these methods, such as allowing for variants to be correlated, can be chosen if appropriate. Graphical commands allow summarized data to be displayed in an interactive graph, or the plotting of causal estimates from multiple methods, for comparison. Although the main method of data entry is directly by the user, there is also an option for allowing summarized data to be incorporated from the PhenoScanner database of genotype—phenotype associations. We hope to develop this feature in future versions of the package. The R software environment is available for download from [https://www.r-project.org/].

	abstract = {Elevated serum urate levels, a complex trait and major risk factor for incident gout, are correlated with cardiometabolic traits via incompletely understood mechanisms. DNA methylation in whole blood captures genetic and environmental influences and is assessed in transethnic meta-analysis of epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) of serum urate (discovery, n = 12,474, replication, n = 5522). The 100 replicated, epigenome-wide significant (p {\textless} 1.1E–7) CpGs explain 11.6\% of the serum urate variance. At SLC2A9, the serum urate locus with the largest effect in genome-wide association studies (GWAS), five CpGs are associated with SLC2A9 gene expression. Four CpGs at SLC2A9 have significant causal effects on serum urate levels and/or gout, and two of these partly mediate the effects of urate-associated GWAS variants. In other genes, including SLC7A11 and PHGDH, 17 urate-associated CpGs are associated with conditions defining metabolic syndrome, suggesting that these CpGs may represent a blood DNA methylation signature of cardiometabolic risk factors. This study demonstrates that EWAS can provide new insights into GWAS loci and the correlation of serum urate with other complex traits.},

This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made.

	abstract = {PLINK 1 is a widely used open-source C/C++ toolset for genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and research in population genetics. However, the steady accumulation of data from imputation and whole-genome sequencing studies has exposed a strong need for faster and scalable implementations of key functions, such as logistic regression, linkage disequilibrium estimation, and genomic distance evaluation. In addition, GWAS and population-genetic data now frequently contain genotype likelihoods, phase information, and/or multiallelic variants, none of which can be represented by PLINK 1’s primary data format.To address these issues, we are developing a second-generation codebase for PLINK. The first major release from this codebase, PLINK 1.9, introduces extensive use of bit-level parallelism, (n)-time/constant-space Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium and Fisher’s exact tests, and many other algorithmic improvements. In combination, these changes accelerate most operations by 1-4 orders of magnitude, and allow the program to handle datasets too large to fit in RAM. We have also developed an extension to the data format which adds low-overhead support for genotype likelihoods, phase, multiallelic variants, and reference vs. alternate alleles, which is the basis of our planned second release (PLINK 2.0).The second-generation versions of PLINK will offer dramatic improvements in performance and compatibility. For the first time, users without access to high-end computing resources can perform several essential analyses of the feature-rich and very large genetic datasets coming into use.},

	abstract = {Observations of functional adenosine triphosphate (ATP)-dependent drug efflux in certain multidrug-resistant cancer cell lines without overexpression of P-glycoprotein or multidrug resistance protein (MRP) family members suggested the existence of another ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter capable of causing cancer drug resistance. In one such cell line (MCF-7/AdrVp), the overexpression of a novel member of the G subfamily of ABC transporters was found. The new transporter was termed the breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), because of its identification in MCF-7 human breast carcinoma cells. BCRP is a 655 amino-acid polypeptide, formally designated as ABCG2. Like all members of the ABC G (white) subfamily, BCRP is a half transporter. Transfection and enforced overexpression of BCRP in drug-sensitive MCF-7 or MDA-MB-231 cells recapitulates the drug-resistance phenotype of MCF-7/AdrVp cells, consistent with current evidence suggesting that functional BCRP is a homodimer. BCRP maps to chromosome 4q22, downstream from a TATA-less promoter. The spectrum of anticancer drugs effluxed by BCRP includes mitoxantrone, camptothecin-derived and indolocarbazole topoisomerase I inhibitors, methotrexate, flavopiridol, and quinazoline ErbB1 inhibitors. Transport of anthracyclines is variable and appears to depend on the presence of a BCRP mutation at codon 482. Potent and specific inhibitors of BCRP are now being developed, opening the door to clinical applications of BCRP inhibition. Owing to tissue localization in the placenta, bile canaliculi, colon, small bowel, and brain microvessel endothelium, BCRP may play a role in protecting the organism from potentially harmful xenobiotics. BCRP expression has also been demonstrated in pluripotential ‘side population’ stem cells, responsible for the characteristic ability of these cells to exclude Hoechst 33342 dye, and possibly for the maintenance of the stem cell phenotype. Studies are emerging on the role of BCRP expression in drug resistance in clinical cancers. More prospective studies are needed, preferably combining BCRP protein or mRNA quantification with functional assays, in order to determine the contribution of BCRP to drug resistance in human cancers.},

Here, we performed untargeted lipidomics analysis of synovial fluid and serum from RA patients at different disease activities and clinical phases (preclinical phase to active phase to sustained remission). We found that the lipidome profile in RA joint fluid was severely perturbed and that this correlated with the extent of inflammation and severity of synovitis on ultrasonography. The serum lipidome profile of active RA, albeit less prominent than the synovial lipidome, was also distinguishable from that of RA in the sustained remission phase and from that of noninflammatory osteoarthritis. Of note, the serum lipidome profile at the preclinical phase of RA closely mimicked that of active RA. Specifically, alterations in a set of lysophosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylcholine, ether-linked phosphatidylethanolamine, and sphingomyelin subclasses correlated with RA activity, reflecting treatment responses to anti-rheumatic drugs when monitored serially. Collectively, these results suggest that analysis of lipidome profiles is useful for identifying biomarker candidates that predict the evolution of preclinical to definitive RA and could facilitate the assessment of disease activity and treatment outcomes.},

	abstract = {Objectives:
Lipid second messengers, e.g. lysophosphatidylcholines (LPC) are involved in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, for instance, rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Unfortunately, the analysis of LPC in complex mixtures as present in body fluids is still challenging.
Design and methods:
Matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) was applied for phospholipid (PL) analysis of organic extracts of synovial fluids from patients with RA as well as the corresponding plasma. These data were compared with results obtained by high resolution 31P NMR spectroscopy.
Results:
Synovial fluids may be replaced by plasma since the analysis of both body fluids gives very similar results. Patients undergoing treatment with TNF-α inhibitors (ADALIMUMAB (HUMIRA®)) were examined in order to investigate whether the clinically-significant attenuation of disease activity is accompanied by changes of the PL composition of plasma. It will be shown that especially the PC/LPC ratios of plasma represent a reliable measure of inflammation and increase upon therapy.
Conclusions:
Since plasma samples are readily available, our approach might be useful to draw conclusions before puncture of the affected joints is necessary and the PC/LPC ratio detected in plasma may serve as an indicator of RA in early stages.},

	abstract = {Although association analysis is a useful tool for uncovering the genetic underpinnings of complex traits, its utility is diminished by population substructure, which can produce spurious association between phenotype and genotype within population-based samples. Because family-based designs are robust against substructure, they have risen to the fore of association analysis. Yet, if population substructure could be ignored, this robustness can come at the price of power. Unfortunately it is rarely evident when population substructure can be ignored. Devlin and Roeder recently have proposed a method, termed “genomic control” (GC), which has the robustness of family-based designs even though it uses population-based data. GC uses the genome itself to determine appropriate corrections for population-based association tests. Using the GC method, we contrast the power of two study designs, family trios (i.e., father, mother, and affected progeny) versus case-control. For analysis of trios, we use the TDT test. When population substructure is absent, we find GC is always more powerful than TDT; furthermore, contrary to previous results, we show that as a disease becomes more prevalent the discrepancy in power becomes more extreme. When population substructure is present, however, the results are more complex: TDT is more powerful when population substructure is substantial, and GC is more powerful otherwise. We also explore general issues of power and implementation of GC within the case-control setting and find that, economically, GC is at least comparable to and often less expensive than family-based methods. Therefore, GC methods should prove a useful complement to family-based methods for the genetic analysis of complex traits.},

Systematic analysis revealed 13,672 genomic risk loci; 1608 were only significant after including non-European populations. Fine-mapping identified causal variants at 6318 signals across 613 traits. One-third (n = 2069) were identified in participants from non-European populations.

Methods We conducted whole-genome sequencing in a discovery adolescent-onset gout cohort of 905 individuals (gout onset 12 to 19 years) to discover common and low-frequency single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) associated with gout. Candidate common SNVs were genotyped in an early-onset gout cohort of 2,834 individuals (gout onset ≤30 years old), and meta-analysis was performed with the discovery and replication cohorts to identify loci associated with early-onset gout. Transcriptome and epigenomic analyses, quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction and RNA sequencing in human peripheral blood leukocytes, and knock-down experiments in human THP-1 macrophage cells investigated the regulation and function of candidate gene RCOR1. Results In addition to ABCG2, a urate transporter previously linked to pediatric-onset and early-onset gout, we identified two novel loci (Pmeta {\textless} 5.0 × 10−8): rs12887440 (RCOR1) and rs35213808 (FSTL5-MIR4454). Additionally, we found associations at ABCG2 and SLC22A12 that were driven by low-frequency SNVs. SNVs in RCOR1 were linked to elevated blood leukocyte messenger RNA levels. THP-1 macrophage culture studies revealed the potential of decreased RCOR1 to suppress gouty inflammation. Conclusion This is the first comprehensive genetic characterization of adolescent-onset gout. The identified risk loci of early-onset gout mediate inflammatory responsiveness to crystals that could mediate gouty arthritis. This study will contribute to risk prediction and therapeutic interventions to prevent adolescent-onset gout.},

In these pathologies, the inflammatory reactions are due to the activation of macrophages responsible for releasing various cytokines including IL-1β. The maturation of IL-1β is mediated by the multiprotein NLRP3 inflammasome. Here, we find that activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome by crystals and concomitant production of IL-1β depend on cell volume regulation via activation of the osmo-sensitive LRRC8 anion channels. Both pharmacological inhibition and genetic silencing of LRRC8 abolish NLRP3 inflammasome activation by crystals in vitro and in mouse models of crystal-induced inflammation. Activation of LRRC8 upon MSU/CPP crystal exposure induces ATP release, P2Y receptor activation and intracellular calcium increase necessary for NLRP3 inflammasome activation and IL-1β maturation.

	abstract = {Objective
Mutations on chromosomes 5p (CCAL2) and 8q (CCAL1) have been linked to familial forms of calcium pyrophosphate deposition disease (CPDD). Mutations in the ANKH gene account for CCAL2, but the identity of CCAL1 has been elusive. Recently, a single Dutch kindred with a mutation in the Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Super Family member 11B (TNFRSF11B) gene coding for osteoprotegerin (OPG) was described as a gain-of-function mutation. Affected family members had premature generalized osteoarthritis (PGOA) and CPDD. As the TNFRSF11B gene is on 8q, we sought additional evidence that TNFRSF11B was CCAL1, and investigated potential disease mechanisms.
Design
DNA from two novel PGOA/CPDD families was screened for sequence variants in the TNFRSF11B gene. Mutations were verified by genotype analysis of affected and unaffected family members. We also investigated effects of normal and mutant OPG on regulators of CPP crystal formation in porcine cartilage.
Results
The identical TNFRSF11B mutation described in the Dutch family was present in two novel PGOA/CPDD families. ANKH was normal in affected patient fibroblasts. Exogenous OPG did not alter ANKH mRNA or protein levels, affect translocation of ANKH to the membrane, nor increase [pyrophosphate (PPi)] or other key regulators of CPDD.
Conclusion
We have firmly established the identity of CCAL1 as TNFRSF11B (OPG). Our findings suggest that this mutation produces disease in an ANKH-independent manner via novel mechanisms not primarily targeting cartilage. This work rationalizes further investigation of OPG pathway components as potential druggable targets for CPDD.},

This study investigated the potential for ANKH sequence variants to promote sporadic chondrocalcinosis. Methods ANKH variants identified by genomic sequencing were screened for association with chondrocalcinosis in 128 patients with severe sporadic chondrocalcinosis or pseudogout and in ethnically matched healthy controls. The effects of specific variants on expression of common markers were evaluated by in vitro transcription/translation. The function of these variants was studied in transfected human immortalized CH-8 articular chondrocytes. Results Sporadic chondrocalcinosis was associated with a G-to-A transition in the ANKH 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) at 4 bp upstream of the start codon (in homozygotes of the minor allele, genotype relative risk 6.0, P = 0.0006; overall genotype association P = 0.02). This −4-bp transition, as well as 2 mutations previously linked with familial and sporadic chondrocalcinosis (+14 bp C-to-T and C-terminal GAG deletion, respectively), but not the French familial chondrocalcinosis kindred 143-bp T-to-C mutation, increased reticulocyte ANKH transcription/ANKH translation in vitro. Transfection of complementary DNA for both the wild-type ANKH and the −4-bp ANKH protein variant promoted increased extracellular PPi in CH-8 cells, but unexpectedly, these ANKH mutants had divergent effects on the expression of extracellular PPi and the chondrocyte hypertrophy marker, type X collagen. Conclusion A subset of sporadic chondrocalcinosis appears to be heritable via a −4-bp G-to-A ANKH 5′-UTR transition that up-regulates expression of ANKH and extracellular PPi in chondrocyte cells. Distinct ANKH mutations associated with heritable chondrocalcinosis may promote disease by divergent effects on extracellular PPi and chondrocyte hypertrophy, which is likely to mediate differences in the clinical phenotypes and severity of the disease.},

Adjusted genotype odds ratio (aORGENOTYPE), the OR for association between one additional minor allele and CC, was calculated and adjusted for age, gender, body mass index (BMI), and osteoarthritis (OA) by using binary logistic regression.

This was independent of age, gender, OA, and BMI; aORGENOTYPE (95\% confidence interval, or CI) was 1.39 (1.14-1.69) (P = 0.001). rs3045 and rs875525, two other SNPs in ANKH, associated with CC; aORGENOTYPE (95\% CI) values were 1.31 (1.09-1.58) (P = 0.005) and 1.18 (1.03-1.35) (P = 0.015), respectively; however, this was non-significant after Bonferroni correction. This study validates the association between a functional polymorphism in the 5′ UTR of ANKH and CC and shows for the first time that this is independent of age and OA – the two key risk factors for CC. It shows that other SNPs in ANKH may also associate with CC. This supports the role of extracellular inorganic pyrophosphate in the pathogenesis of CC.

Methods Gout cases and AH controls (serum urate (SU) ≥6.0 mg/dL) from the UK Biobank were divided into discovery (4934 cases, 56 948 controls) and replication (2115 cases, 24 406 controls) cohorts. GWAS was conducted and PRS generated using summary statistics in discovery cohort as the base dataset and the replication cohort as the target dataset. The predictive ability of the model was evaluated. GWAS were performed to identify variants associated with gout compared with normouricaemic controls using SU {\textless}6.0 mg/dL and {\textless}7.0 mg/dL thresholds, respectively.
Results Thirteen independent single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in ABCG2, SLC2A9, SLC22A11, GCKR, MEPE, PPM1K-DT, LOC105377323 and ADH1B reached genome-wide significance and replicated as predictors of AH to gout transition. Twelve of 13 associations were novel for this transition, and rs1229984 (ADH1B) was identified as GWAS locus for gout for the first time. The best PRS model was generated from association data of 17 SNPs; and had predictive ability of 58.5\% that increased to 69.2\% on including demographic factors. Two novel SNPs rs760077(MTX1) and rs3800307(PRSS16) achieved GWAS significance for association with gout compared with normouricaemic controls using both SU thresholds.
Conclusion The association of urate transporters with gout supports the central role of hyperuricaemia in its pathogenesis. Larger GWAS are required to identify if variants in inflammatory pathways contribute to progression from AH to gout.},

Here, we provide insights into the molecular mechanism of the poorly understood inflammatory component of gout from a genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 2.6 million people, including 120,295 people with prevalent gout. We detected 377 loci and 410 genetically independent signals (149 previously unreported loci in urate and gout). An additional 65 loci with signals in urate (from a GWAS of 630,117 individuals) but not gout were identified. A prioritization scheme identified candidate genes in the inflammatory process of gout, including genes involved in epigenetic remodeling, cell osmolarity and regulation of NOD-like receptor protein 3 (NLRP3) inflammasome activity. Mendelian randomization analysis provided evidence for a causal role of clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential in gout. Our study identifies candidate genes and molecular processes in the inflammatory pathogenesis of gout suitable for follow-up studies.},

	abstract = {Objective The genetic basis of calcium pyrophosphate deposition (CPPD) disease is largely unknown. This limits the development of therapeutic strategies. We aimed to analyze a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a large administrative database to identify new candidate causal genes for CPPD disease.
Methods We used publicly available GWAS summary statistics for chondrocalcinosis and for crystal arthropathy from the Veterans Affairs Million Veteran Program in people of African (AFR) and European (EUR) ancestry. Included were 3,004 (536 AFR and 2,468 EUR) cases for chondrocalcinosis and 3,766 (700 AFR and 3,066 EUR) cases for crystal arthropathy. Our primary analysis was in chondrocalcinosis with secondary analysis in crystal arthropathy. We tested for colocalization of chondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with genetic control of gene expression.
Results There were two genome-wide significant loci for chondrocalcinosis in both AFR and EUR, both on chromosome 6 (signals within the ENPP1 and RNF144B genes). Findings were supported by analysis of the crystal arthropathy cohort. Colocalization analysis of chondrocalcinosis genetic association signals with genetic control of gene expression and alternative splicing further supported ENPP1 and RNF144B as candidate casual genes. At ENPP1 the allele that increases the risk for chondrocalcinosis associated with increased ENPP1 expression.
Conclusion ENPP1 encodes ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase / phosphodiesterase family member 1 that produces AMP and pyrophosphate, potentially contributing to the formation of calcium pyrophosphate crystals. Selective ENPP1 inhibitors developed for infectious disease and cancer could be repurposed for the treatment of chondrocalcinosis and CPPD disease.},

Both families presented with a common phenotype including early age at onset and deposition of crystals of calcium pyrophosphate dihydrate in a similar pattern of affected joints. Affected family members were karyotypically normal. Linkage to the short arm of chromosome 5 was observed, consistent with a previous report of linkage of the CPPDD phenotype in a large British kindred to the 5p15 region. However, recombinants in the Argentinean kindred have enabled us to designate a region{\textless}1 cM in length between the markers D5S416 and D5S2114 as the CPPDD locus.},

Due to the phenotypic complexity of CPPD, the European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) recently made recommendations on terminology, diagnosis, and management based on available research evidence and expert consensus. There are no disease-modifying treatments for CPPD disease, and therapy remains nonspecific with the use of anti-inflammatory and analgesic drugs. For years, it has been known that inorganic phosphate and pyrophosphate regulate the formation of CPP or hydroxyapatite crystals. The discovery of ANKH (human homologue of progressive ankylosis) mutations in familial CPPD disease confirmed the importance of phosphate/pyrophosphate homeostasis in CPPD, with ANKH being a regulator of inorganic pyrophosphate transport. Despite progress in our understanding of the function of ANKH, much remains to be investigated. This review summarizes the genetic basis of this disease and focuses on the challenges of research in this area.},

To investigate the polygenetic basis of serum uric acid levels, we conducted a meta-analysis of genome-wide association scans from 14 studies totalling 28,141 participants of European descent, resulting in identification of 954 SNPs distributed across nine loci that exceeded the threshold of genome-wide significance, five of which are novel. Overall, the common variants associated with serum uric acid levels fall in the following nine regions: SLC2A9 (p = 5.2×10−201), ABCG2 (p = 3.1×10−26), SLC17A1 (p = 3.0×10−14), SLC22A11 (p = 6.7×10−14), SLC22A12 (p = 2.0×10−9), SLC16A9 (p = 1.1×10−8), GCKR (p = 1.4×10−9), LRRC16A (p = 8.5×10−9), and near PDZK1 (p = 2.7×10−9). Identified variants were analyzed for gender differences. We found that the minor allele for rs734553 in SLC2A9 has greater influence in lowering uric acid levels in women and the minor allele of rs2231142 in ABCG2 elevates uric acid levels more strongly in men compared to women. To further characterize the identified variants, we analyzed their association with a panel of metabolites. rs12356193 within SLC16A9 was associated with DL-carnitine (p = 4.0×10−26) and propionyl-L-carnitine (p = 5.0×10−8) concentrations, which in turn were associated with serum UA levels (p = 1.4×10−57 and p = 8.1×10−54, respectively), forming a triangle between SNP, metabolites, and UA levels. Taken together, these associations highlight additional pathways that are important in the regulation of serum uric acid levels and point toward novel potential targets for pharmacological intervention to prevent or treat hyperuricemia. In addition, these findings strongly support the hypothesis that transport proteins are key in regulating serum uric acid levels.},

	abstract = {Objective To estimate the current prevalence rates and decadal trends of gout and hyperuricemia in the US, as well as the prevalence of urate-lowering therapy (ULT) among gout patients, using 2007–2016 data from a nationally representative survey of American men and women (the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey [NHANES]). Methods Using data from 5,467 participants in the NHANES 2015–2016, we estimated the most recent prevalence rates of gout and hyperuricemia. When the NHANES was conducted, all participants were asked about their history of gout (as diagnosed by a health professional) and medication use. Hyperuricemia was defined as having a serum urate level of {\textgreater}7.0 mg/dl in men and {\textgreater}5.7 mg/dl in women. We examined decadal trends in these estimates using data from the NHANES 2007–2016 and investigated ULT usage trends using the NHANES 2007–14 (the most recent data available to date). Results In 2015–2016, the prevalence of gout was 3.9\% among adults in the US (9.2 million people), with 5.2\% [5.9 million] in men and 2.7\% [3.3 million] in women. Mean serum urate levels were 6.0 mg/dl in men and 4.8 mg/dl in women, and hyperuricemia prevalence rates were 20.2\% and 20.0\%, respectively. The prevalence rates of gout and hyperuricemia remained stable between 2007 and 2016 (P for trend {\textgreater} 0.05). The prevalence of ULT use among patients with gout was 33\% in 2007–2014 and remained stable over time (P for trend {\textgreater} 0.05). Conclusion In this nationally representative survey sample of adults in the US, the prevalence rates of gout and hyperuricemia remained substantial, albeit unchanged, between 2007 and 2016. Despite these rates, only one-third of gout patients were receiving ULT.},

	abstract = {Urate is one of the key metabolites of purine metabolism, and the overproduction of urate in the liver or decreased excretion in the kidney in humans may lead to elevated levels of urate in the circulation, termed hyperuricemia (HU). The formation of monosodium urate (MSU) crystals in the joint or surrounding tissues may trigger inflammatory responses and gout attacks, which is the most common inflammatory arthritis. In addition to gout, HU has also been associated with many other metabolic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, obesity, diabetes, fatty liver diseases, kidney diseases, hypertension, and various cancers. Overwhelming evidence indicates that HU and gout lead to systematic metabolic alterations underlying these metabolic disorders. As one of the most powerful omics techniques, metabolomics systematically analyzes all small-molecule metabolites in a biological system that directly reflect the physiological and pathological conditions. In recent years, metabolomics has been increasingly employed in clinical and experimental research in HU and gout. Emerging studies have developed predictive models to differentiate HU from gout based on metabolomics and machine-learning algorithms. In this review, we systematically summarize recent advances in metabolomic research in gout and HU in animal and human clinical studies. A comprehensive understanding of systemic metabolic changes caused by HU and gout may provide unprecedented insights into the pathological mechanisms in HU, gout, and related metabolic diseases, which may have a profound impact on the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of HU and gout.},

Metabolomics is divided into untargeted metabolomics and targeted metabolomics according to different research modes. Each other's advantages can be fully utilized by combining the two so that the results of metabolomics research can be consummated. 20 HUA patients and 20 healthy individuals participated in the experiment, and untargeted metabolomics was employed to find 50 differential metabolites in HUA serum samples. Twelve candidate biomarkers were screened based on literature research and ROC Curve analysis for subsequent verification. Based on the UPLC-TQ-MS analysis platform, the targeted metabolomics detection methods were established and the content of 12 candidate biomarkers was precisely quantified. Compare with the results of untargeted metabolomics, the targeted metabolomics results were considered more reliable.},

	issn = {0049-0172},
	doi = {10.1016/j.semarthrit.2022.152022},
	abstract = {Objectives
The gouty arthritis (GA) progression was multistage, yet the GA clinical diagnosis guidelines were more inclined to suitable for acute gouty arthritis (AGA), thus neglecting of the progress of GA. This study aimed to identify specific biomarkers that were competent for reflecting the progression of GA and attempted to provide evidence for seasonable intervention of appropriate clinical treatment.
Methods
A total of 547 patients with GA at sequential stages and healthy volunteers were divided into a training set (n = 347) and a validation set (n = 200). Serum metabolic profiles were determined by UHPLC-QTOF-MS-MS untargeted metabolomics, and biomarkers were identified by logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic analysis. Further, UHPLC-QE-MS was applied for accurate quantitative validation of identified potential biomarkers in the validation set samples.
Results
After serum metabolic profiles analysis by untargeted metabolomics, 12 metabolites with monotonous change trend were screened, and were verified by targeted metabolomics subsequently. The quantitative results showed the serum concentration of kynurenic acid(KYNA), N1-Methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide(2PY), DL-2-Aminoadipic acid(2AMIA) and 5-hydroxyindole acetic acid(5-HIAA) of patients with sequential stages showed a strictly monotonic trend, and AUC was 0.97, 0.97, 0.96 and 0.95, respectively.
Conclusions
KYNA and 5-HIAA are related to acute inflammation of GA, while 2PY and 2AMIA are related to renal function damage caused by long-term HUA. Therefore, we believe it is inappropriate to use a single biomarker to define the phase of GA. Actually, four biomarkers obtained in this paper should be integratedly adopted to evaluate the progression of GA with sequential stages.},

An intriguing aspect is the occurrence of gout in only 10–15\% of hyperuricemic individuals, suggesting the presence of additional risk factors. Although MSU crystal deposition is widely recognized as the cause of gout flares, the variability in initiating the inflammatory response to hyperuricemia and MSU deposition is not well understood. Several studies bring up-to-date information about the environmental and genetic influences on the progression towards clinical gout. Elevated urate concentrations and exposure to different external factors precipitate gout flares, highlighting the potential involvement of epigenetic mechanisms in gouty inflammation. A better understanding of the alteration of the epigenetic landscape in gout may provide new perspectives on the dysregulated inflammatory response. In this review, we focus on understanding the current view of the role of epigenomic reprogramming in gout and the mechanistic pathways of action.},
